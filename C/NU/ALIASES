:                     ALIASES -- NDOS Sample Alias File
:
:
:     The aliases in this file are designed to give you some examples of
:     how NDOS aliases can be used and the power they have. It is not
:     intended to be an exhaustive list, and many of these may not be
:     appropriate for your needs. But they should give you a feel for how
:     to use aliases to help get your work done.
:
:     CAUTION:  These aliases are EXAMPLES. They may not
:     work properly when run on your system -- they are simply intended
:     to show what's possible and give you a feel for how to write your
:     own set of aliases. You may find some of them useful, but others
:     may fail or have unintended effects when they are run on a system
:     other than the one they were designed for.
:
:     This file is designed to be loaded with an ALIAS /R command, for
:     example:
:
:               alias /r aliases
:
:     You can also load aliases from a batch file, but ALIAS /R is much
:     faster. See the manual for more details on loading aliases.
:
:     We suggest you put your standard aliases are in a self-contained
:     file like this one which can be invoked from AUTOEXEC. That
:     way the file can also be re-invoked after it is edited, to 
:     reinstall the aliases.
:
:
:
:     The next few aliases set up some directory commands that provide
:     shorthand ways to view the directory in several different formats
:     (see the DIR command in the manual for more details).
:
:     Note that none of these aliases has any arguments specified (%1,
:     %2, etc.). This means that all arguments on the actual command line
:     will be appended to the alias text. For example:
:
:             d2 x*
:
:     is equivalent to:
:
:             dir /2pv x*
:
:     and:
:
:             d2 x* y* z*
:
:     is equivalent to:
:
:             dir /2pv x* y* z*
:
d2 dir /2pv
dex dir /o:e
dir *dir /p
wh*ereis dir /sp
:
:     The last two commands above demonstrate the use of an asterisk to
:     terminate alias expansion and to shorten the name of an alias.
:
:     In the first case, if the command were defined as:
:
:             alias dir dir/p
:
:     it would generate an alias loop error. The inclusion of the "*"
:     makes NDOS terminate alias expansion for that command, which
:     allows the redefinition of a command with specific switch settings. 
:     In this case "dir" is redefined as "dir/p", which will cause
:     directories to be displayed with a pause at the end of each page.
:
:     The "whereis" command demonstrates truncation of an alias name.
:     The * is placed after the last required character in the name, so
:     the "whereis" command can be entered as "wh", "whe", "wher", 
:     "where", "wherei", or "whereis".
:
:
:     The following aliases are more shorthand:  DD and DU (directory
:     down and directory up) for pushd and popd, L for list, etc.
:
dd pushd
du popd
l list
clr mode mono
:
:
:     Here's what the next few aliases do:
:
:             more:   Uses NDOS's LIST /S as a substitute for the DOS MORE
:                     command. Note the use of the * to allow the command
:                     to be entered as MO, MOR, or MORE
:             sdel:   Allows you to select files for deletion from a subset
:                     of files as specified in the command argument. For
:                     example:
:
:                             sdel *.obj
:
:                     will allow you to select files to delete from a list
:                     of all .obj files. (See the SELECT command in the
:                     manual for more details).
:
:             up:     Moves "up" in the directory tree, that is, to the 
:                     parent directory.
:
:             ov:     Moves "over" in the directory tree, to another 
:                     subdirectory which has the same parent as the current
:                     directory.
:
mo*re list /s
sdel select del (%1)
up cd ..
ov cd ..\%1
:
:     The next alias shows how arguments can be passed to commands.
:     The arguments given when the alias is invoked are passed to the
:     program at the appropriate places in its command string.
:
ps d:\peri\ps /t:%1 /x:%2 /e:4
:
:     The next few aliases demonstrate several things. Some use the
:     command separator character ^ to include multiple commands in
:     the alias. The last two (PC and BACK) use the alias called IN
:     to do their job. In fact IN was designed for "internal" use by
:     other aliases in this file, though it could be used elsewhere as
:     well. Note that, while PX is set up before it is referenced in
:     other aliases, this is not really necessary, because any command
:     in one alias which refers to another is handled when the alias is
:     invoked, not when it is set up with the alias command.
:
:     Here's what each alias does:
:
:             nd:     Creates a new directory below the current directory,
:                     then changes to it.
:
:             w:      Saves the current directory, changes to the wp
:                     directory on drive c:, runs the wp program using
:                     the first argument on the command line, and
:                     restores the original directory when done.
:
:             zap:    Deletes all the .bak files in the current directory,
:                     then does a wide directory listing.
:
:             in:     "Pushes" a different directory, executes a command,
:                     including all of the arguments on the command line,
:                     and then goes back to the original directory. See
:                     PUSHD, POPD, and Alias Parameters in the manual for 
:                     more details.
:
:             pc:     Changes to the \comm directory on drive c:, runs
:                     the program called pcomm, then returns to the
:                     drive and directory in use when the command was
:                     executed.
:
:             back:   Changes to the \backup directory on drive d:, runs
:                     the program called tape, then returns to the previous
:                     drive and directory.
:
nd md %1^cd %1
w pushd c:\wp^wp %1^popd
zap del *.bak^dir /w
in pushd %1^%2&^popd
pc in c:\comm pcomm
back in d:\backup tape
:
:     The following aliases make use of the %& argument. This argument
:     means "all of the arguments on the command line". For example:
:
:             zap2 *.bak *.lst *.bk!
:
:     expands to:
:
:             erase *.bak *.lst *.bk!^chkdsk^dir /w
:
:     The last of the three aliases below uses the %@eval function to
:     create a command-line calculator, by simply passing all arguments
:     on the command line to the function.
:
zap2 erase %&^chkdsk^dir /w
ed edit %&^del *.bak
cal*c echo The answer is:  %@eval[%&]
:
:     The following two aliases, taken from the manual, show how 
:     to combine alias with keystack to invoke a program and pass
:     parameters to it. See the manual for details on what they do.
:     Note that the 0s in the keystack strings simulate an empty
:     keyboard buffer; the 13s are carriage returns.
:
321 keystack 0 13 0 13 0 13 0 13 0 13 "/fr" 0 "%1" 13^123
drpt pushd c:\data^keystack "use times index times" 13 "report form timerep to print" 13 "quit" 13^dbase^popd
:
:
:     The following aliases show the use of IFF in aliases. The first
:     redefines SET so that it displays the environment variables with a
:     /P if no parameters are given, or processes the SET if parameters
:     are specified. The second checks whether the argument is a directory;
:     if so it deletes the files in the directory and then removes the
:     directory. If not, it gives an error message.
:
set iff "%1"=="" then *set /p ^ else *set %& ^ endiff
zap iff isdir %1 then ^ *del %1 ^ *rd %1 ^ else ^ beep ^ echo Not a directory! ^ endiff
