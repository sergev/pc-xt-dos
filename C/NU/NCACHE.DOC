Windows 3.1 compatibility
================================================================

This release of Norton Cache is fully compatible with Windows
3.1 in both the Standard and Enhanced modes.  The Windows SETUP
program may warn that NCACHE is incompatible with Windows 3.1.
This warning is related to prior versions of NCACHE, and should
be ignored.

We have discovered, and Microsoft has confirmed, that Windows
is incompatible with ANY disk cache that uses Expanded Memory.
With a cache in EMS it is possible for the machine to lock up,
particularly when running DOS programs in a window.  Because of
this, we have changed NCACHE to always shrink EMS cache buffers
to 0K when Windows is running.  This means that only one number
(the DOS cache size) should be specified with the /EXP switch.
We stronly recommend using XMS Extended Memory for the cache if
you run Windows (e.g. use the /EXT switch).


Program Changes
================================================================

NCACHE has been changed so cache buffers can be placed in either
Expanded (EMS) or Extended (XMS) memory, but not both.  Only one
of the /EXT and /EXP switches should be used.

The manual indicates that the /INSTALL switch uses all available
Extended and Expanded memory for caching under both DOS and
Windows.  NCACHE actually leaves 16K of Extended and/or Expanded
memory free under DOS, and reduces to 25% of that amount under
Windows.  If using 25% would reduce the cache size to 256K or
less, the cache is disabled while in Windows (reduced to 0K).
The cache automatically resumes operation upon return to DOS.

The manual indicates that if only one memory size is given to
the /EXT switch (e.g. /EXT=512), the cache size will be the
same under both DOS and Windows.  NCACHE actually uses the
size specified under DOS, but reduces to 25% of that amount
under Windows.  If using 25% would reduce the cache size to
256K or less, the cache is disabled while in Windows (reduced
to 0K).  The cache automatically resumes operation upon return
to DOS.  If both a DOS and Windows memory size are explicitly
given (e.g. /EXT=512,128), NCACHE will always use that amount.

The default write buffer size has been changed to a maximum of
8K.  NCACHE previously used the size of the largest track as
the size of the write buffer.  On the vast majority of systems
there is no noticable performance increase from a write buffer
larger than 8K.  If you want a larger write buffer, you can
still use the /WRITE switch to set the exact size.


Command line switches
================================================================

Three new command line switches have been added to NCACHE.
The /MULTI and /DISKRESET switches control very technical
options that will only be needed by a few advanced users.
Don't worry if you don't understand the descriptions below!
You can safely ignore these switches because NCACHE defaults
to the most compatible setting.

/DUMP

  Forces all updated data waiting in cache buffers to be written
  to disk.  The DUMP switch can only be used after NCACHE is
  installed.

/MULTI=ON|OFF

  Enables or disables the multitasking aspects of IntelliWrites.
  MULTI=OFF by default for maximum compatibility.  You may want
  to experiment with the MULTI=ON switch.  This will improve
  system performance slightly, but may not be compatible with
  all computers and BIOS's.  The MULTI switch can be used either
  during installation or reconfiguration.

/DISKRESET=ON|OFF

  This switch determines how NCACHE responds to "Disk Reset"
  DOS calls (INT 21H/AH=0DH).  When DISKRESET=ON (the default),
  NCACHE dumps all cached data to disk when a Disk Reset is
  requested.  The program doing the Disk Reset is suspended
  until all data has been written to disk.  When DISKRESET=OFF
  NCACHE ignores Disk Reset calls.

  Most programs never request a Disk Reset and are unaffected
  by this switch.  Other programs request a Disk Reset only
  on rare occasions (e.g. when they exit), and will also be
  unaffected.  There are some programs, however, that request
  many Disk Resets.  Cache performance will be reduced when
  running these programs because NCACHE won't be allowed to
  write to disk in the background (doing disk writes in the
  background is what gives NCACHE most of its speed).  If you
  frequently run programs that do many Disk Resets, you may
  want to set DISKRESET=OFF.  The DISKRESET switch can be
  used either during installation or reconfiguration.

The /QUIET switch has always been available in NCACHE, but was
inadvertently left out of the manual.  This switch prevents
NCACHE from displaying any messages on the screen unless there
is an error.


Compatibility Notes
================================================================

We have attempted to make NCACHE one of the most compatible
disk caching programs available.  NCACHE will work with almost
any hard disk supported by DOS.  It is important to understand,
however, that it is impossible to test any cache against all
the computers and disk drives ever sold.  There is simply too
much variety in the PC marketplace, and very few machines are
exactly alike.

NCACHE integrates itself closely with the operating system and
hardware, and may be effected by compatibility problems that
would not show up with standard applications programs (e.g.
word processors and spreadsheets).  If your computer isn't 100%
compatible, you may be able to run standard programs perfectly,
but be unable to use NCACHE.

In many cases, using the /MULTI=OFF or /WRITE=0 switches during
cache installation will solve any compatibility problems.  You
should try using /MULTI=OFF before using /WRITE=0.  /MULTI=OFF
can solve many compatibility problems, and results in only a
small loss in performance.  If you have an older computer, you
may also want to check with the vendor to see if a more recent
ROM BIOS is available.

NCACHE is fully compatible with the Stacker and SuperStor data
compression drivers.  We do not recommend using NCACHE with any
other data compression products.

If you are using Stacker SSWAP, SuperStor DEVSWAP, or any other
program that lets you dynamically swap drive letters, you must
do all such swapping BEFORE loading NCACHE.  Swapping drive
letters after NCACHE is loaded may result in data being written
to the wrong disk, possibly overwriting other information.

For full compatibility with all versions of Windows, NCACHE
emulates Microsoft's SmartDrive disk cache.  If NCACHE is
loaded, SYSINFO will report that both the NCACHE and SmartDrive
device drivers are present.  This is normal.  Also, if NCACHE
is loaded and you attempt to load SmartDrive 4.0, SmartDrive
will believe that it is already resident.

If you are using the combination of NCACHE, Windows Enhanced
Mode, and the QEMM-386 memory manager, you must obtain QEMM
version 5.13 or later.  If you are using QEMM version 6.00,
we recommend upgrading to version 6.01.

Many SCSI host adapters now use bus mastering techniques to
increase performance.  When using such an adapter on a 386
or 486 computer, you must use a device driver that supports
the Virtual DMA Services (VDS) specification.  VDS is an
industry standard that allows bus mastering devices to work
with 386 memory managers.  Almost all SCSI adapters now have
VDS compatible drivers available; contact your vendor for
upgrade information.

NCACHE only works on "normally connected" floppies.  If the
floppy drive requires a special interface board or a device
driver, NCACHE probably won't be able to cache it.  Most
external drives are not supported by NCACHE.

NCACHE is unable to cache a floppy drive that does not have
"Change Line" support.  This is a hardware feature on the
drive that tells the computer when a diskette has been removed.
360K drives often do not have a change line, and thus cannot be
cached.  NCACHE will work fine on most other drives (1.2M, 720K,
1.44M, etc.).  NCACHE will automatically determine which drives
can be cached.  If a drive cannot be cached, NCACHE will either
report "Cannot detect media change for this drive" or simply
omit the drive from its status display.

In order to use Expanded Memory (EMS) with NCACHE, you must have
an expanded memory manager that implements Version 4.0 of the
EMS specification (sometimes called the "LIM spec").  You must
also have true EMS support through hardware or through a driver
such as QEMM.  You can't use a software emulator like Above Disc.

If you have an older memory manager, check with your memory
board manufacturer to see if an upgrade is available.  In
most cases all you'll need is new memory manager software;
no hardware changes will be required.

NCACHE will normally ignore EMS memory if you don't have the
correct memory manager.  If you run NCACHE with no parameters
it will simply skip over EMS and try to use Extended or
conventional memory instead.  If you provide an explicit /EXP
switch, you will receive an error message and NCACHE will not
install itself.

Due to a conflict in Expanded Memory (EMS) usage, Borland's
Paradox SE database management system is incompatible with
NCACHE.  However, NCACHE is compatible with the "professional"
Paradox version 3.5 and above.  Using the command line switch
"-EMK 0" when loading Paradox SE may allow it to work with
NCACHE.  If this does not work, NCACHE must be unloaded before
using Paradox SE.

If you are using the RCD.SYS driver with IOMEGA removable disk
drives, you must use version 7.0 or later, and you must load
the driver in low memory.  RCD version 7 is compatible with
all types of IOMEGA disk drives, and both ISA and MicroChannel
computers.  Please contact IOMEGA for an upgrade if you are
using an earlier version.

Only one disk cache program can be loaded on the computer at
once.  You must remove any other cache (e.g. SMARTDRIVE or
PC-KWIK) before installing NCACHE.  Multiple disk cache programs
may conflict with each other and corrupt disk data.

NCACHE is not compatible with Zenith DOS 3.3 Plus when any hard
disk partitions are larger than 32MB.

There is a potential incompatibility between NCACHE delayed
writes and early versions of the American Megatrends (AMI) 486
BIOS.  The most recent version of the AMI BIOS appears to be OK,
but older versions may exhibit a random lock up when delayed
writes are used.  If you experience a lock up, simply disable
the delayed writing feature with the /WRITE=0 command line
switch during cache installation.  You may also want to contact
your system vendor to see if a more recent BIOS is available
for your computer.

If you use a program that automatically reboots your computer,
there is the potential that data stored in the cache will not
be written to disk.  The BE REBOOT command automatically resets
NCACHE, but other rebooting programs will not.  We recommend
either changing to use BE REBOOT, or using an NCACHE RESET
command right before the command that reboots the system.

On most computers, NCACHE will trap the CTRL-ALT-DEL sequence
used to reboot the system.  If there is unwritten data stored
in cache buffers, NCACHE will write it to disk before rebooting.
Some 386 memory managers and some keyboard enhancement programs
prevent NCACHE from trapping CTRL-ALT-DEL.  If NCACHE is unable
to detect CTRL-ALT-DEL on your computer, you should disable the
delayed writing feature with the /WRITE=0 command line switch
during NCACHE installation.

When using certain 386 memory managers, Windows may not function
properly if there is less than 16K of free Extended and/or
Expanded Memory.  If you use the /INSTALL switch, NCACHE will
automatically leave 16K memory free.  If you set the cache size
manually using the /EXT or /EXP switches, you need to ensure
that at least 16K of memory will be free.  Please note that this
problem is not just related to NCACHE.  If you have a RAM disk
or other drivers using Extended or Expanded memory, you must
also ensure that at least 16K is free before running Windows.
If you will never run Windows, you may use all available memory
for NCACHE.

Ventura Publisher Version 2.0 Standard Edition has problems
working with many drivers and TSR's, including NCACHE.  If you
encounter "Internal Error 19" dialog boxes, you need to upgrade
to Version 3.0 or later of Ventura Publisher.

Some anti-virus products can corrupt device driver files,
including NCACHE.  The Norton Anti-Virus DOES NOT have this
problem, and is fully compatible with NCACHE.  The products
that have a problem are those that directly modify .EXE files
to store checksums or other data.  Note that NCACHE is not
the only driver this may effect.  Any driver file with an
EXE extension can be corrupted, including the SETVER.EXE
driver in MSDOS 5.0.

If you are unable to boot your system because of an NCACHE
compatibility problem, you can prevent NCACHE from installing
by holding down the CTRL key as it is loading.
