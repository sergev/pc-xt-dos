                         WESTERN DIGITAL
             "PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARD DRIVERS
                          FOR USE WITH 
 NOVELL ADVANCED NetWare, SFT NetWare, AND ELS NetWare LEVEL II
                     v2.1 AND LATER VERSIONS

                       RELEASE INFORMATION

             Version 3.04         13 December 1989


This Western Digital driver for Novell Advanced NetWare, SFT 
NetWare and ELS NetWare Level II (v2.1 and later versions) 
has been tested by Western Digital and certified by Novell. 


VERSION HISTORY

-- Version 3.04 (Current Version, December 1989) --

With this release of the driver new functions have been added to 
increase the drivers flexibility and some old problems have been 
fixed.  This driver supports the entire Star/EtherCard PLUS and 
EtherCard PLUS16 family of LAN adapters.

        NOTE:  Do not use the NetWare 386 version 3.0 MAP ROOT
               function with version 3.04 or earlier versions
               of this driver. 

In this release the driver will read the configuration information
directly from registers in software configured XT/AT bus adapters
(currently WD8003EB & WD8003W) in the same fashion that Micro 
Channel adapters have been configured in the past. This "Auto 
Configuration" feature will eliminate the need to reconfigure the 
driver to match different adapter configurations.

When using StarLAN adapters this driver can be configured to use 
either the Novell StarLAN driver compatible packet format (AT&T 
StarLAN compatible) or the standard IEEE 802.3 packet format.  

More information about these features as well as tips on how to 
best utilize them can be found in the file INSTALL.DOC.

This driver contains fixes for two problems which existed in 
previous drivers, including the Novell certified v2.11.3 driver. 
Problem 1; A workstation problem, had to do with the IPX call to 
CancelRequest and occurred only in certain NetBIOS applications 
which call this IPX function. Problem 2; Occurred only on certain 
adapter revisions when under high load situations. This problem 
would cause the server to "lock up" or get a GPI interrupt.
 
-- Version 3.02 (September 1989) --

This release provides support for the EtherCard PLUS16 adapter.
It contains a completely new driver configuration table to support 
adapters with 8, 16, and 32 Kbytes of RAM. The default configur-
ation has changed to IRQ 3, Base I/O 280, RAM at CA00:0 for 8K.

There is one known problem with this driver, Configuration 12 
(IRQ=2, I/O Base=220, RAM at C000:0 for 32K) will NOT function 
with Ethercard PLUS16 in the file server.  

NOTE: This driver has been tested by Western Digital and distri-
buted on a limited basis. 

-- Version 2.11.3 (February 1989) --

The driver files were moved to the root directory to comply
with new NetWare v2.15 installation procedures, and the
WD8003.LAN file was changed to specify floppy disk volume label 
LAN_DRV_200 instead of LAN_DRV_002.  No software changes to the 
actual driver were made.

Two additional versions of 2.11.3 are available.  These are not
Novell certified drivers.  They are slight alterations of the
certified driver designed to meet specific Novell network
installation requirements.

2.11.3b is designed to allow intermixing of Western Digital
Ethernet and StarLan boards in a Novell bridge.  Without 2.11.3
the two segments of the network will not see each other.

2.11.3c is designed to operate with Tandy 1000SL series
computers.  If you do not use the c version with Tandy 1000SL
the driver does not determine the bus type (Micro Channel or
XT/AT) and the driver will not operate.

NOTE:  Versions b and c work with no apparant problems, however
they are not certified by Novell and cannot be distributed on
the SuperDisk.  If you require these versions contact LAN
Technical Support at 714-852-4900.


-- Version 2.11.3 (November 1988) --

Changes were made to meet Novell certification requirements.
There were no problems reported by any users with the previous
version.


-- Version 2.11.2 (August 1988) --

Problems were fixed that

     o prevented interoperation with Ethernet adapters
       from certain other manufacturers

     o caused workstations to stop when receiving certain
       queries from Novell Diagnostic Utilities


-- Version 2.11.1 (July 1988) --

The following problems having to do with differences between
NetWare v2.1 and v2.11 were corrected:

     o StarLAN adapters would not operate on any NetWare v2.11

     o No adapters would operate on Non-Dedicated NetWare v2.11


-- Version 2.11.0 (June 1988) --

Operation with Ethernet and StarLAN Micro Channel adapter boards
has been added to both the shell and server drivers.  The same 
drivers also operate with XT/AT bus boards.


-- Version 2.10.0  (May 1988) --

Two problems that were present in previous versions of this
driver have been corrected:

     o A server or workstation would occasionally stop
       functioning when the network was under extremely
       heavy load.

     o Certain application programs that used the Novell
       NETBIOS interface would not operate properly.

This version and subsequent versions have the following 
characteristics:

     o accommodates LAN adapter boards with 32 Kbyte RAM buffers
       as well as those with the original 8 Kbyte RAM buffers

     o has improved workstation transmit speeds

     o the RAM buffer base address in the workstation shell is 
       changed from C4000 (hex) to D0000 to minimize conflicts 
       with other adapter boards (especially EGA, VGA)
