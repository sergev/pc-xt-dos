                         WESTERN DIGITAL
             "PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARD DRIVERS
                          FOR USE WITH 
 NOVELL ADVANCED NetWare, SFT NetWare, AND ELS NetWare LEVEL II
                     v2.1 AND LATER VERSIONS

                       INSTALLATION GUIDE

This disk provides a single driver for the entire "PLUS" 
(WD8003, WD8013) family of Western Digital LAN adapter boards
for XT/AT and Micro Channel bus systems.

Included in this subdirectory are the following files:

   INSTALL.DOC     This File.
   RELEASE.DOC     Version number and specific
                     release information.

Included in the root directory are the actual driver files:

   WDPLUS.LAN                   The LAN driver descriptor file.
   WDPLUSAD.OBJ                 The Server A-Driver object file.
   WDPLUSBD.OBJ                 The Server B-Driver object file.
   WDPLUSCD.OBJ                 The Server C-Driver object file.
   WDPLUSDD.OBJ                 The Server D-Driver object file.
   WDPLUSSH.OBJ                 The Shell Driver object file.

                              NOTE

     NetWare installation procedures require the driver files
     listed above to be located in the root directory of a
     floppy disk whose volume label is LAN_DRV_200.  If you 
     copy these files to another floppy disk, be sure that
     you set the volume label of the new disk to LAN_DRV_200.

Refer to the NetWare Installation manual and follow the instructions 
for loading a new LAN driver from a floppy disk.  

During software generation, you must choose "Load and Select 
Item" from the "LAN Driver Options" menu.  At the point in the 
procedures where you are directed to select the LAN drivers, the
WDPLUS drivers will appear in the list of choices as follows:

                Western Digital Star/EtherCard PLUS


RAM BUFFER SIZE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION

When generating a server or shell for XT or AT bus adapters, there 
are various configurations that can be selected, one of the parameters 
is the RAM buffer size. There are configuration selections designating 
RAM sizes of 8, 16, and 32 Kbytes of RAM. During shell or server 
initialization the driver adjusts to the adapter once the adapter's 
type and RAM size are determined.

Adapter's with 8 Kbytes of RAM can be used with configuration 
selections which specify 8, 16, or 32 Kbytes of RAM.

Adapter's with 32 Kbytes of RAM must be used with configuration 
selections which specify 32 Kbytes of RAM.
 
WD's AT bus 16 bit adapters can function in two modes, 16 bit mode 
and 8 bit mode. In 16 bit mode, the adapter performs 16 bit data 
transfers and utilizes the full 16 Kbytes of RAM. In 8 bit mode,
the adapter performs 8 bit data transfers and utilizes only 8 
Kbytes of RAM.

To operate the 16 bit adapter in 16 bit mode, place the adapter in a
16 bit bus slot and configure the driver to a configuration selection 
which specifies 16 or 32 Kbytes of RAM.

To operate the 16 bit adapter in 8 bit mode, configure the driver to a
configuration selection which specifies 8 Kbytes of RAM or place the 
adapter in an 8 bit bus slot and specify any driver configuration.
    
			      NOTE

   The drivers "Default" configuration specifies 8 Kbytes RAM and 
   therefore will cause the 16 bit adapter to function in 8 bit mode.  

FILE SERVER CONFIGURATION

For adapters that utilize onboard jumpers to select I/O base address, 
interrupt request level (IRQ) and RAM base address, choose configuration 
selections which specify hardware settings that meets your needs. Then 
configure your adapters to match the hardware settings selected.

Software configured adapters include all Micro Channel adapters and 
XT/AT bus adapters which are configured with the SETUP program. For 
these adapters, choose driver configuration selections for the "First", 
"Second", "Third", or "Fourth Software Configured Adapter" based on the 
number of software configured adapters in your server. The driver will 
then read the configuration information directly from the adapter. With 
XT/AT bus adapters the order (first, second, third, fourth) is determined 
by the adapter's I/O Base Address, from lowest to highest. With Micro 
Channel adapters order is determined by the Micro Channel bus slot number 
from lowest to highest. 

                              NOTE

   If your NetWare server contains more than one Micro Channel 
   LAN adapter board, be sure that you manually select a 
   different Interrupt Request (IRQ) channel for each adapter
   before running the Novell NETGEN procedure.  To do this, 
   you must use the manual configuration option of the Set 
   Configuration program on your PC system Reference Diskette 
   when you install the boards.


SHELL DRIVER CONFIGURATION

This Western Digital shell driver has been designed to limit the need 
to reconfigure or regenerate the IPX.COM file even though a variety 
of WD adapters and adapter configurations may be present in your 
workstations.   

For adapters that utilize onboard jumpers to select I/O base address, 
interrupt request level (IRQ) and RAM base address, choose configuration 
selections which specify hardware settings that meets your needs. Then 
configure your adapters to match the hardware settings selected.

Software configured adapters include all Micro Channel adapters and 
XT/AT bus adapters which are configured with the SETUP program. The shell 
driver automatically detects these adapters and reads the configuration 
information directly from the adapter, even if the configuration entry 
selected specified a different I/O base, IRQ, and RAM base. 
 
Therefore, an IPX.COM file generated for a specific hardware configuration
will function with all adapters set to that particular hardware setting. Plus 
it will function with all Micro Channel and XT/AT bus software configured 
adapters because the shell driver reads the configuration information directly 
from the those adapter.  

To create a driver which will function on software configured adapters
only, select the configuration entry for "First Software Configured 
Adapter".

If your workstation has more than one software configured adapter, 
select "First", "Second", "Third", or "Fourth Software Configured
Adapter" based on which adapter you want IPX.COM to use. With XT/AT bus 
adapters the order (first, second, third, fourth) is determined 
by the adapter's I/O Base Address, from lowest to highest. With Micro 
Channel adapters order is determined by the Micro Channel bus slot number
from lowest to highest.

CUSTOM DRIVER CONFIGURATIONS

If an XT/AT bus workstation or server requires some combination of 
interrupt, I/O Base and RAM address that is not offered in one of 
the configuration choices, you can use the NWPATCH1 program to create 
a custom configuration to meet your needs. This patch utility is 
distributed with this driver.

STARLAN CONFIGURABILITY

This driver (both server and shell) when used with WD StarCard PLUS
adapter family is default configured to use the same packet protocol used 
by the Novell StarLAN driver for AT&T StarLAN adapters. This maintains 
compatibility in a network with AT&T adapters using the Novell driver. 
This packet protocol limits the maximum packet size to 512 bytes and will 
not function if packets are routed across a non-Novell bridge.

The drivers may be reconfigured using the NWPATCH1 program, to use the
standard 802.3 packet protocol with a maximum packet size of 1024 bytes.
If your network requires that you route packets across a non-Novell 
bridge you MUST reconfigure your drivers to the 802.3 packet protocol.
If your network uses only WD StarLAN adapters you can reconfigure your 
drivers to take advantage of increased driver performance due to the 
increased maximum packet size. Remember, when changing the packet protocol
both the server and workstation drivers must be reconfigured.   
