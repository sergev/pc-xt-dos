                    DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM FOR
              "PLUS" FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARDS

          Version 1.11                 December 12, 1989

VERSION HISTORY

-- Version 1.11 (Current Version) --

Version 1.11 supports Twisted Pair boards on both
AT and Micro Channel busses.
This version also has fixes for all bugs reported in
version 1.10. 
This includes IRQ=10 from the command line using an 
8013EBT.

-- Version 1.10 --

Version 1.10 supports the EtherCard PLUS16 (WD8013EBT).
In addition, it provides support for use with batch files.
This version also has fixes for all bugs reported in
version 1.00.

A problem exists with fast Micro Channel bus systems with
clock speeds over 16 MHz.  Diagnose will not be able to 
properly identify adapters in those machines.
Also, EtherCard PLUS TP will have some bugs with this
revision.

-- Version 1.00 --

This is the first version of this program.  Certain errors have
been encountered using the command line parameters.  When using
the /SLOT: parameter option on Micro Channel bus systems the
Diagnostic Program will not always detect the adapter properly.
Continued use of the Diagnostic Program with menu operation will
produce accurate results.
