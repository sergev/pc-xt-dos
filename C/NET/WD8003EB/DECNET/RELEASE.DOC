                        WESTERN DIGITAL
               "PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARD DRIVER
              FOR USE WITH DEC's DECnet-DOS and PCSA/PC

                      RELEASE INFORMATION

        Version 2.06                     January 3, 1990

This directory contains the DECnet-DOS (*) and PCSA/PC driver
version 2.06 for the "PLUS"-Family (*) LAN adapter boards.

Refer to Installation materials from Digital Equipment 
Corporation for information on the installation of the DEC 
software.  Additional information on installation of Western 
Digital adapters can be found in the file INSTALL.DOC in this 
disk directory.  Board configuration information can be found in 
the WD Installation manual for the LAN adapter you are using.

Customers have favorably commented on the price/performance of 
the Western Digital LAN adapters.  The additional buffer space of the driver and on-board memory coupled with the high performance 
hardware architecture of the Western Digital LAN adapters is 
responsible for this increase in performance.

MODIFICATION HISTORY

-- Version 2.06 (Current Version, January 3, 1990)

A problem with using the /O with PCSA has been fixed. Previously,
only lower case "o" was accepted.  Now, a capital "O" is accepted
as well.  This is needed because "net start" out of PCSA will 
change a lower case "o" in "msnet.ini" to uppercase before 
calling DLL.

This version fixes a problem with using DLL without having a 
DECPARM.DAT file.  Previously, the source Ethernet address used 
came out as all 0's if DECPARM.DAT was missing, or if no DECnet 
node address was set in DECPARM.DAT.  Now, the Ethernet address 
used defaults to the LAN adapter's 6-byte hardware address.

This version adds support for the Western Digital 16-bit XT/AT 
Bus Ethernet adapter, the EtherCard PLUS16 (WD8013EBT), the 
latest Western Digital Ethernet Micro Channel adapter, the 
WD8003E/A, and the Western Digital 10BaseT Adapters, the Ether-
Card PLUS10T (WD8003W) and the EtherCard PLUS 10T/A (WD8003W/A).

A new command line option, /u, has been added to allow unloading
of a previously running copy of DLL.  This is useful where DLL is
used with other software that allows unloading, and can save the
user from having to reboot the machine to unload the software.

A problem was reported that on some machines, the DLL would never
appear to work, even though it appeared to load correctly.  On 
other machines, it would send packets, but never receive any from 
the network.  The problem has been found and fixed.

A problem which caused most received packets to be discarded when
using StarLAN adapters has been fixed.  Due to a problem in the
network adapters, the length reported in the receive buffer 
header is often in error, and the packet is discarded.  A soft-
ware workaround was put in to correct the problem.

A problem with Micro Channel adapters not working at IRQ's other
than IRQ3 has been fixed.

Code has been added to correctly handle receive ring overwrites
should they ever occur.

The dll was changed to have an option to not require the 
scheduler.  As shipped on the SuperDisk, the default option is to 
require the scheduler, but at runtime, the user can use the /n 
option to reverse the default and not require the scheduler.  The 
default option may be changed by use of debug and searching for 
the following string:
	
	Default to Require Scheduler: <Y>
	
If the "Y" is changed to an "N", the default with no options will
be to not require the scheduler.  Then, a /s option will reverse 
that and cause the scheduler to be required and used.

When no scheduler is required, the dll will not make calls to the
scheduler using "int 6C" and will set up its own interrupt stack.
In this case, the memory resident size will be 40 hex paragraphs
larger due to saving space for the interrupt stack.

For compatibility with DECnet DOS/PCSA 3.0, the installation 
check function within DLL was changed to return ES:BX pointing to 
a secondary DLL interrupt handler routine which handles functions
in the method of release 2.0 and earlier.  This routine expects
the function code in the AH register instead of in AL with a 
module ID in AH as used with interrupt 69H.  DEC routines such as 
the LAST transport layer will get this function address through 
the installation check call, then make direct calls to the 
function without going through interrupt 69H.

-- Version 2.05 (June 1989)

The Micro Channel (*) adapters are now supported.  For Micro Channel adapters, the /IRQ, /IO, /SM, and /SIZE parameters are 
all set based on the configuration of the adapter as set in the 
Programmable Option Select (POS) Registers.  These values are set 
when the board is configured or installed using the Reference 
diskette.

For Micro Channel machines only, a /SLOT parameter is used if 
multiple Western Digital LAN adapters are installed in the 
machine to specify which adapter to use.

The same version of the DLL is used for both Micro Channel and 
XT/AT (*) bus machines.  The driver detects the type of machine,
and changes options accordingly.

Support is now included for use in machines using VGA adapters.  
DEC has modified its 2.1 software to use a new software interrupt 
so as to avoid the known conflict with VGA adapter standards.  
The WD 2.05 driver has been modified to support both the old and 
the new interrupt, depending on the version of DEC software you 
are running.  (Use HELP for description.)

DLL.EXE now works correctly with the executable NETBIOS.EXE.  
Previously, if NETBIOS.EXE was used as SESSION.EXE, when starting 
the redirector an error message "Unexpected error in adding local 
name" would appear, and the redirector was unusable.  The 
redirector was able to be successfully used with the NETSESS.EXE 
version of SESSION.EXE, however.  Applications which used 
NETBIOS.EXE directly would get "Out of Resources" error messages.

The /size parameter was added to allow use of more than the first 
8K of adapter RAM on boards which have more installed, such as 
the 32K option on some network adapters.

HELP has been added to DLL.  (dll /?)

The ability to store DECnet database files in a user selectable 
directory was added through the use of an option on the command 
line.

-- Version 2.04 (February 1989) --

A reported problem in transferring large files to a PC has been 
fixed.

This driver has been modified to support DEC 2.1 software.

The release numbering system was changed from 2.n to 2.0nx, where 
n is a numeral and x, if present, is a letter indicating still in 
field test and considered a Beta release.

-- Version 2.2 (November 1988) --

Version 2.2 fixes a reported problem on old style XTs in which
the PC would sometimes hang.

-- Version 2.1 (August 1988) --

Upgraded to support Local Area Disk (LAD).

The problem reported in Multicast handling has been fixed.

The default hardware setting for DLL.EXE is now interrupt level
3, instead of 2, to match the factory setting.

A problem in release 1.0 has been fixed in the Hello timer
handling which was causing some systems to hang for no apparent
reason.

To change the settings from the command line you can use either
the version 1 format using "=" or the version 2 format using ":"
as the delimiter.  For example,

           DLL /IRQ=3 /IO=280 /SM=DE00
  or
           DLL /IRQ:3 /IO:280 /SM:DE00
