The DLL.EXE driver contained on this diskette is for use with the
"PLUS"-family (*) LAN adapter boards for Ethernet, StarLAN, and
Ethernet Twisted-Pair. This driver operates with DEC's DECnet-DOS (*) 
or PCSA/PC Software.

This document contains the information about how to install a
Western Digital "PLUS"-family LAN adapter board and the DLL DECnet
driver on DEC's DECnet network.

1. Jumper the adapter according to your system configuration.

The DLL Device Driver is installed at PC boot time according to
the command line specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (described
below).  The user must ensure that the software settings given on
the device driver command line match the jumper settings on the
adapter board.

Jumper settings for some adapter boards are described in the
JUMPERS.DOC file.  For more information, refer to the Western
Digital "User Installation Guide" that comes with each adapter
board.

For Micro Channel (*) adapters, the interrupt, I/O base address,
and RAM base address are established by the system configuration
procedure when the adapter is installed in the machine.

2. Insert the adapter in your PC.

3. Power up your PC.

4. Install DEC's Software

Follow the appropriate instructions for either DECnet-DOS or
PCSA/PC from Digital Equipment, selecting the "3COM"* option
whenever asked to choose an adapter type.  Specifics for the WD
hardware are defined below.  You may view the options for the
WD driver with or without having any DEC software or an adapter
installed by typing:

           dll /?

4A. For DECnet-DOS: Install the DECnet-DOS network software
using the DIP.EXE installation program supplied on the
DECnet-DOS diskette.  Select ETHERNET communications during the
installation.

Next, copy the Western Digital driver DLL.EXE from this diskette
to the \DECNET directory of your system drive.  For example,

           COPY A:\DECNET\DLL.EXE C:\DECNET\DLL.EXE

Next, edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the DLL driver as
described in step 5.

4B. For PCSA/PC: Have your system administrator create a KEY
diskette for your system.  The KEY diskette should be created
with your DECnet address and your personal startup files.

Next, copy the Western Digital driver DLL.EXE from this diskette
to the appropriate directory of your KEY diskette.  For example,
with your KEY diskette in drive A: and this diskette in drive B:,
type:

           COPY B:\DECNET\DLL.EXE A:\xxxxxx\DLL.EXE

Next, edit file MSNET.INI on your KEY diskette as described in
step 5A or 5B.  (Make sure to change ALL occurrences of DLL.)

5A. XT/AT(*) Bus adapters: You need to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT or
MSNET.INI files to load the DLL.EXE driver and to reflect the
jumper selections of step 1.  Use the format:

C:\DECNET\DLL /IRQ:irq /IO:base /SM:page /SIZE:size (AUTOEXEC.BAT)

                          or

DLL /IRQ:irq /IO:base /SM:page /SIZE:size (MSNET.INI)

                          where,

irq- IRQ level to receive adapter board interrupts, jumper W2 (3)

base- I/O base address in hexadecimal, jumper W1 (280)

page- 4-digit memory segment byte address of the shared buffer 
        memory (not set by jumpers) (D000)

size- size of the shared memory on the adapter board (8, 16 for
	WD8013EBT)

NOTE:  Figures in parentheses are factory default values for
most Western Digital adapter boards.

The DLL.EXE defaults are given in parentheses.  Note that the
DLL.EXE defaults to IRQ3 to match the "PLUS"-Family boards,
shipped with the jumper set to IRQ3.

For example, the following statement corresponds to the factory
jumper configuration of the adapter and an 8K buffer memory base
address of DE000:

           DLL /IRQ:3 /IO:280 /SM:DE00 /SIZE:8

To change the settings from the command line for version 1 of
DECnet-DOS, you may use the version 1 format using "=" instead of
the version 2 format using ":" as the delimiter.  For example,

           DLL /IRQ=3 /IO=280 /SM=DE00 /SIZE=8
  or
           DLL /IRQ:3 /IO:280 /SM:DE00 /SIZE:8


Your "irq" options for the /IRQ Interrupt parameter are: 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, or 7, or also 10, 11, or 15 for the WD8013EBT.

     Your "base" options for the /IO I/O base address parameter
are: 3E0, 3C0, 3A0, 380, 360, 340, 320, 300, 2E0, 2C0, 2A0, 280,
260, 240, 220, or 200.  (Be aware that there may be conflicts
above 360.)

     Your "page" options for the /SM shared memory parameter
are: 8000 - F000, on 8K-byte boundaries (increments of 200 hex).
EGA and VGA can create problems below the D000 and D400 address
respectively.  (The DLL.EXE driver defaults to D000; there are no
jumpers for this on the adapter board.)

     Your "size" options for the /SIZE shared memory size
parameter are: 8, 16, or 32.  (This is the size of the shared
memory in kilobytes on your adapter board.  The default is 8,
except for WD8013EBT where the default is 16.)

5B. Micro Channel Bus adapters: You need to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT or
MSNET.INI files to load the DLL.EXE driver and to make sure the automated
installation procedure has not added command line options which are not
needed for the Micro Channel version.  Use the format:

           C:\DECNET\DLL        (AUTOEXEC.BAT)

                           or

           DLL                  (MSNET.INI)

For Micro Channel adapters, IRQ, IO, SM, and SIZE should not be specified
(and will be ignored, except an error message will be generated).  The
actual values used are those set by the system configuration procedure
for the adapter.

If you have more than one Western Digital Micro Channel LAN adapter installed
in your system, you must tell DLL which one to use.  The board is referenced
by the slot in which it is installed, using the /SLOT parameter.  For example,
if you have an Ethernet adapter in slot 5, and a Starlan adapter in slot 3,
and you wish to run DECnet using the Ethernet adapter, use:

           DLL /SLOT:5

Although you may specify SLOT when only one adapter is installed, you
should let SLOT default, so that if you later move the adapter, you will
not need to change AUTOEXEC.BAT or MSNET.INI.

6. Reboot the system.
