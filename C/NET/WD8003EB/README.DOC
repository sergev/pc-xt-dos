Drivers for each LAN operating system are located in separate
subdirectories as follows:

      Subdirectory                 Contents
 
     NETWAR20 <DIR>       Novell Advanced NetWare (*) v2.0a 
     NETWAR21 <DIR>       Novell Advanced NetWare, SFT NetWare,
                            and ELS NetWare Level II v2.1 and 
                            later versions
     NWPATCH1 <DIR>       Patch Utility for NetWare Drivers
     DECNET   <DIR>       DEC DECnet-DOS (*) and DEC PCSA (*)
     LANMAN   <DIR>       3Com 3+ Open, Microsoft LAN Manager, 
                            and NDIS driver (DOS and OS/2)
     3PLUS <DIR>          3Com 3+ (*)

On 5-1/4 inch diskettes labeled Diagnostics, and all 3-1/2 inch
diskettes and high density 5-1/4 inch diskettes:

     
     DIAGNOSE <DIR>       Diagnostic Program and support files
     NADD <DIR>           Program to display the base I/O of
                            installed LAN boards

                            software such as the IBM (*) PC LAN
                            Program and Microsoft MS-NET (*)

On 5-1/4 inch diskettes labeled Setup and all high density 
diskettes:


    SETUP <DIR>          EtherCard PLUS with Boot ROM Socket,
                           and EtherCard PLUS10T Setup Program

In addition to the driver itself, each subdirectory contains:

     o an INSTALL.DOC or USER.DOC file that explains how to 
       install and use the software; and

     o a RELEASE.DOC file that states the current version,
       release date, and any improvements that were made
       in this version of the software.

NOTE 1:  The INSTALL program only copies files to the target
drive.  If you are installing NetWare then you MUST use the
Driver disk itself.  Novell requires a certain volume label on
the driver disk, and this label is not copied to the target disk
(whether it is a floppy or hard disk).  DISKCOPY should be used
if you need additional Driver disks for Novell installations.

The SuperDisk set includes DIAGNOSE Program, a diagnostic for
Western Digital PLUS Family LAN adapters.  It is located in
the directory /DIAGNOSE and its use is described in the file 
user.doc.  Also included is a network utility called NADD 
which is used to identify LAN boards in your PC.

The SuperDisk set provided with EtherCard PLUS with ROM Socket
(WD8003EB) and EtherCard PLUS10T (WD8003W) also includes the 
SETUP program, used to configure the electrically eraseable ROM 
(EEROM) on these adapters used to save the configuration information.

All of the drivers on the SuperDisk function with both XT/AT bus
systems and Micro Channel bus systems:  

    StarLAN:     StarCard PLUS (WD8003S)
                 StarLink PLUS (WD8003SH)

contains documentation, diagnostic software, and drivers for use
with Western Digital products.  You can call it at (714) 756-8176
using a 1200 or 2400 bps modem.

In addition to the latest versions of drivers and other software
on SuperDisk, the Bulletin Board contains:

  o A Micro Channel board driver for Western Digital's
    ViaNet 3.06 LAN Operating System
  o Sun PC-NFS (*) driver
  

== OTHER AVAILABLE PRODUCTS ==

Most other LAN operating systems provide drivers to use with 
Western Digital "PLUS"-family LAN adapters.  Some of these 
products that are available from Western Digital are:

  Software                   Description

  PC/TCP     A complete set of TCP/IP protocols that allows PCs 
             to communicate with minicomputers, mainframes, and 
             engineering workstations using the DoD standard 
             TCP/IP protocols.  PC/TCP (*) features include file 
             transfer, remote host login and 3270/VT100 terminal

  ViaNet     Western Digital's fully distributed LAN operating 
             system that lets all PCs be servers as well as work-
             stations.  It makes all network resources available 
             to every user, and operates with the DOS 3.1 
             operating system and file structure on every PC.  
             ViaNet also allows UNIX and DOS systems to 
             interoperate on the same network.

the EtherCard PLUS with ROM socket (WD8003EB F200 or WD8003EB 
F205) depending on which adapter has been installed. 

The UNIX V.3 Streams driver has been removed.

also been moved to the Diagnostic Disk.  The Micro Channel
SuperDisk remains on one disk and includes the Diagnostic
Program and NADD.

Both the DECnet DOS and 3Com 3+ drivers have been revised to
operate with Micro Channel adapters.  LAN Manager drivers for DOS
and OS/2 have been added.  The UNIX V.3 driver has been placed
on the 5.25 inch disks again.  It is located on the Diagnostic
Disk.

Please review the appropriate RELEASE.DOC and INSTALL.DOC files
