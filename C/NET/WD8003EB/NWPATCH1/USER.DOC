     NWPATCH1.EXE is a patch utility for Novell NetWare (*) drivers 
     that operate with Western Digital (WD) "PLUS" (WD8003) family 
     LAN adapter boards.  This utility will patch the following files:
     
     NetWare v2.0a:  (WD driver versions 3.04)
             ANET3.COM - WORKSTATION
             NET$OS.EXE - SERVER

     NetWare v2.1:   (WD driver versions 3.04)
             IPX.COM - WORKSTATION
             NET$OS.EXE - SERVER
             NET$OS.EX1 - SERVER (this file contains hardware configurations)
             NET$OS.EX2 - SERVER (this file contains StarLAN configuration)

     NetWare ELS     (WD driver versions 3.04)
             ANET3.COM - WORKSTATION
             NET$OS.EXE - SERVER 

                               NOTE
        NetWare drivers for Micro Channel adapters configure
        themselves automatically and never need to be patched.

     A COPY of the file to be patched should be put in your default
     drive/directory before the patch program is executed.  It is not
     safe to patch a driver unless there is a backup copy of the
     original driver saved on a different disk or directory.

     The patch program can then be started by typing NWPATCH1.  The
     user should know:

        o whether the driver is for a workstation or server;
        o which Novell version of NetWare the driver is from;
        o for a server driver, whether it is to be the primary, 
          secondary, etc.; 
        o the name of the file to be patched

     Follow the instructions given by the patch utility to change
     the:
             PC INTERRUPT (IRQ)
             BASE I/O ADDRESS
             SHARED RAM MEMORY BASE ADDRESS
             SHARED RAM MEMORY SIZE
             StarLAN PACKET PROTOCOL

     When the parameters displayed match the values desired,
     enter 'E' or 'e' to save them in the appropriate driver file.

     To quit the program without making any changes in the driver
     file, enter 'Q' or 'q'.
