                         WESTERN DIGITAL
                 NETWORK ADDRESS DISPLAY PROGRAM
                               FOR
                "PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARDS

                           USER GUIDE


This program (NADD.EXE) displays the I/O base address and
network address of every "PLUS" (WD8003) family StarLAN,
Ethernet, and Ethernet Twisted Pair adapter board installed 
in the computer.  It operates in both XT/AT and Micro Channel 
bus systems.

To run this program, type

           NADD

and press RETURN.

The I/O base address (200 - 3E0) of every installed LAN adapter 
will be shown in hexadecimal.  This information may be helpful
in determining how many adapters are installed, and at what
I/O base addresses they are located.

The network address of each adapter, which is a 48 bit binary 
number, will be shown as 12 hexadecimal digits.  Some network 
programs require this information.
