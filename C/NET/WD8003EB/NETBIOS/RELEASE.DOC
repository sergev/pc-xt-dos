			 WESTERN DIGITAL
		  NETBIOS/OSI INTERFACE PROGRAM
			       FOR
		"PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARDS

		       RELEASE INFORMATION
	  Version 3.1.9 	       05 September 1989


The purpose of this document (file RELEASE.DOC) is to briefly
explain the contents of this diskette.	The file WPLUSNBE.EXE
is the NETBIOS/OSI Interface Program, intended for use with the
Western Digital PLUS family LAN adapter boards (WD8003\WD8013).

Refer to the WD8003-NB NETBIOS/OSI Interface Program Installation
Guide (or file INSTALL.DOC) for an explanation of the command line
parameters that can be used with this program.

This version of the WD8003-NB NETBIOS/OSI Interface Program is
intended for use with:

	o IBM PC Local Area Network Program
	o Microsoft MS-NET

or other NETBIOS compatible software.


OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Please consider the following when using the NETBIOS/OSI
Interface Program:

o The ViaNet 3.06 Network Operating System will not function
  with the NETBIOS/OSI Interface Program loaded.

o The specified frame size includes OSI protocol headers and thus
  the bytes available for actual data transfer in a datagram are
  somewhat less than the frame size.

o This version includes parameterized storage allocation.  When
  used in a network operating system server configuration,
  especially with the IBM PC LAN Program, the default number of
  buffers should be increased for optimal performance.
  (Use /nlb:20, /nsb:60)


MODIFICATION HISTORY

<< Version 3.1.9 -- Current Version: September 1989 >>

Added support for WD8013EBT (16-bit high performance Ethernet
card). Also added logic so that the only command line
parameter needed is "base:" for boards with interface chip
(e.g. 8003EB).

<< Version 3.1.7 -- Current Version: November 1988 >>

There is no functional difference in this version.  The
organization of the code was changed for compatibility with
a ROM version.


<< Version 3.1.6 -- September 1988 >>

This version provides command line parameters for better
control of the storage allocated by the program.  It also
saves memory by deallocating initialization code.  Other
features include the ability to use the full 32K RAM available
on WD8003EBT and WD8003WT boards, and support for use as a
second adapter.


<< Version 3.1 -- 26 May 1988 >>

This version handles Western Digital adapter boards for
Micro Channel bus systems as well as the original XT/AT bus
adapters.  The Program determines on its own which type of
board is installed and adjusts its operation accordingly.
Certain command line parameters are no longer used with
Micro Channel bus adapters (see INSTALL.DOC instructions).


<< Version 3.0 -- 1 March 1988>>

This and future versions of the NETBIOS/OSI Interface
Program use an improved communication protocol that makes
them incompatible with previous versions (2.1 and earlier)
of the Program.  Version 3.0 or subsequent versions must
now be used with every adapter board in the network.

Only 8K of the 32K RAM buffer on WD8003EBT adapter boards
is supported by this version.
