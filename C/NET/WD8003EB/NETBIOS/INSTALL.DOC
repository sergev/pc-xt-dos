          "PLUS"-FAMILY StarLAN/ETHERNET PC ADAPTER BOARDS

ADAPTER BOARDS

    This program is for use with Western Digital "PLUS"
    (WD8003\WD8013) family LAN adapter boards.

LOADING THE PROGRAM

    After booting DOS, type the following when the DOS prompt 
    is displayed:

         WPLUSNBE   ... parameter list ...

    "... parameter list ..." is an optional list of parameters 
    in the form "/parameter_name:value".  These are described
    in detail in the following section.  The parameters which 
    may be selected include:

    o    length of the user frame to be transmitted by the 
         transport layer

    o    LAN address for this node

    o    base I/O address of the LAN adapter board (*)

    o    base address for the on-board shared RAM memory (*)

    o    PC IRQ level to receive LAN adapter board interrupts (*)

    o    Storage allocated for various internal data structures

    o    Select use as a second adapter configuration

          * These parameters are not used with Micro Channel 
            bus adapter boards because their values are 
            established during system configuration when
            you install the adapter board.

    Any one or more of these parameters may be selected in 
    any order.  Defaults are assigned to each parameter so 
    that none of them need be specified if the standard 
    configuration is desired.

    To remove the NETBIOS/OSI Interface Program or change any
    of its parameters after it has been loaded, DOS must be
    rebooted.


PARAMETER SPECIFICATION

    The format for specifying parameters for WPLUSNBE.EXE is:

         WPLUSNBE /parameter_name:value /parameter_name:value

    where "/" is the DOS switch character, "parameter_name" is the
    parameter name described below, and "value" is an acceptable
    value for the parameter as described below.  The command line 
    may specify none or a combination of parameters.  Each 
    parameter must be preceded by the switch character "/".  If 
    the parameter can be assigned a value (all except for "v" and 
    "?"), the colon (:) delimiter must follow the parameter_name.

    The following parameters may be selected as command line 
    options:

    /base:n   Specifies the base I/O address (n) of the LAN 
              adapter board.  (Not used for Micro Channel
              bus boards.)

              "n" must be a three digit hexadecimal value in the
              range 200 through 3E0.  Acceptable values are
              200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 2A0, 2C0, 2E0, 300, 320,
              340, 360, 380, 3A0, 3C0 and 3E0.

              Default: /base:280

    /frmsiz:n Specifies the maximum Transport Protocol Data Unit
              size (n).  This is approximately the amount of 
              application data that is sent out per message frame.

              "n" is a decimal value.  Acceptable values are
              128, 256 and 512.

              Default: /frmsize:512

    /irq:n    Specifies the interrupt level (IRQ) that the 
              LAN adapter board will use to notify the PC.
              (Not used for Micro Channel bus boards.)

              Possible values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

              Default:  /irq:3

    /page:ppp Page number to be used for the base address of
              the on-board memory that is shared with the PC.
              The range of possible base addresses is 80000 
              to FE000 in steps of 2000.  This corresponds 
              to 512K to 1M decimal in steps of 8K.
              (Not used for Micro Channel bus boards.)

              The page number "ppp" must be specified as the
              first three hexadecimal digits of the base
              address.  Acceptable values for "ppp" are
              therefore 800 to FE0 in steps of 20 (hex).

              Certain base addresses are frequently used for
              other functions in the PC and are therefore
              not suitable:

                C0000, C8000, CA000 and E0000-FE000 are
                typically used for BIOS ROMs

                A0000-BE000 are used for graphics RAM.

              Default:  /page:C40
              
    /node:a   Specifies the IEEE 802 standard LAN address to
              be used for this network node if there is a 
              need to override the hardware address of the
              LAN adapter board.

              "a" must be a six byte (12 digit) hexadecimal 
              value entered in ascending byte order.  That is, 
              the least significant byte of the address must 
              be the first byte of the parameter value.

              Default:  the node address contained in the LAN 
              Address ROM on the LAN adapter board.

    /cmd:n    Specifies the number of NCB commands supported.
              Each NCB command consumes 18 bytes.

              Default: /cmd:32   Max: /cmd:32

    /ses:n    Specifies the number of sessions supported.
              Each session consumes 249 bytes.

              Default: /ses:32   Max: /ses:32

    /nlb:n    Specifies the number of large buffers supported.
              Each large buffer consumes 607 bytes.

              Default: /nlb:10   Max: /nlb:40

    /nsb:n    Specifies the number of small buffers supported.
              Each small buffer consumes 147 bytes.

              Default: /nsb:30   Max: /nsb:60

    /wz:n     Specifies the size of the transport window.  This
              is the number of packets the protocol will transmit
              before waiting for an acknowledgement.  Making this
              number larger improves efficiency but uses more 
              buffers.

              Default: /wz:4   Max: /wz:4

    /2nd      Tells the driver to operate as the 2nd LAN adapter.
              This permits it to be used in the same machine as
              an IBM Token Ring adapter.

    /v        Displays program version and banner information 
              without permanently loading and running the 
              program.

              The version and banner information are 
              automatically displayed whenever the program is 
              loaded normally.  The "v" parameter does not 
              take a value.

    /?        Displays HELP information (the list of valid 
              parameters) without permanently loading and
              running the program.

              The "?" parameter does not take a value.

    The "v" and "?" parameters can also be invoked when the
    NETBIOS/OSI Interface Program is already loaded and running.
