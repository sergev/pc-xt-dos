Version 1.0

This version did not support the Micro Channel bus.

Mail Minder (mminder) is a program in 3+ MAIL that periodically 
checks to see if you have mail.  If used with Version 1.0 of 
this driver, it does not inform you that you have received new 
mail.  When manually invoked with the hot keys, it returns a 
"Server Not Responding" error.

The user can manually read any mail that has been received by 
using the MAIL program.  

A program is available from the Western Digital Technical 
Support Bulletin Board that solves this problem.
