                          WESTERN DIGITAL
           "PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARD DRIVER FOR USE WITH 
                 3COM'S 3+ NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM

       INSTALLATION GUIDE             January 16, 1990


This document contains the information about how to install a
Western Digital WD8003/WD8013 family LAN adapter board and driver 
in 3Com's 3+ (*) network.

1. Jumper the adapter according to your system configuration.

The WD.SYS Device Driver is installed at PC boot time according 
to the command line specified in the DOS CONFIG.SYS file 
(described below).  The user must verify that the jumper settings 
on the adapter board correspond to the software settings given on 
the device driver command line.

Jumper settings for some adapter boards are described in the
JUMPERS.DOC file.  For more information, refer to the Western 
Digital "User Installation Guide" that comes with each adapter 
board.

2. Insert the adapter in your PC.

3. Power up your PC.

4. Install the 3Com 3+ network software as specified in the 3Com
Installation and Configuration Guide.

5. After the installation is complete, copy the Western Digital 
driver WD.SYS from this diskette to the root directory of your
system drive with a new name called ETH.SYS.  For example,

                 CD A:\3PLUS
                 COPY A:WD.SYS C:\ETH.SYS (XT/AT bus)
                               C:\ETH523.SYS (Micro Channel)

If 3+NetConnect (*) has been installed and the Western Digital 
board is being used as a remote (secondary) network adapter, a 
secondary driver (2WD.SYS) is used.  If necessary, copy that 
secondary driver to the root directory.  For example,

                 COPY A:2WD.SYS C:\2ETH.SYS (XT/AT bus)
                                C:\2ETH523.SYS (Micro Channel)

6. If you changed the LAN adapter board's default parameters in 
step 1, you need to modify the DEVICE=[2]ETH.SYS command line in 
your CONFIG.SYS file to reflect the jumper selections of step 1.  
Use the format:

                 DEVICE=ETH.SYS irq base page  (XT/AT bus)
    	         DEVICE=2ETH.SYS irq base page (XT/AT bus)
		   
		 DEVICE=ETH523.SYS irq base page  (Micro Channel)
		 DEVICE=2ETH523.SYS irq base page (Micro Channel)

where,

   irq  - IRQ level to receive adapter board interrupts      (3)

   base - I/O base address (in hexadecimal)                (280)

   page - 4-digit memory segment byte address of the     (D0000)
          shared buffer memory (not jumpered on the board)  

The factory jumper settings for the WD8003/WD8013 adapters
and the WD.SYS default buffer memory base address are given in 
parentheses.

If these default values conflict with other adapter boards 
installed in your system, you may need to change the values used  
by the LAN adapter. For example, if you want to change the IRQ 
level to 4 and the buffer memory base address to D4000 (segment  
address D400), then you'll have to change the line

             "DEVICE=ETH.SYS" to "DEVICE=ETH.SYS 4 280 D400"

before rebooting the system.

PLEASE NOTE:  There are a number of PC boards that can conflict 
with various possible shared memory addresses.  For example, the 
VGA and EGA graphics adapters seem to use the area of memory in 
the range of C000 through D400, depending on the type of adapter.  
We have found D000 to be a good address for users of EGA  
adapters;  D400 or DE00 work well for systems with the VGA 
adapters.  If you are seeing any problems in getting the system 
to function, try moving the shared memory base address.

7. Reboot the system.

For Micro Channel bus systems:

1. Configure the Micro Channel adapter using the .ADF file 
supplied on the driver disk with your adapter.  Use either the 
manual or automatic configuration routines, ensuring that the 
settings do not conflict with other devices in your system.

2. Continue the installation process using steps 2 through 7
above.
