The Western Digital PLUS family LAN adapters use three resources
to communicate with the computer system.  These are the IRQ
(interrupt), I/O Base Address, and RAM buffer area.  The LAN
adapter board does not have the capability to share these
resources.  This means that problems can occur if you try to
share these areas with other add-on boards or other parts of the
computer that use these resources.

Below is a description of the three resources and what common
devices use them.  Use this as a guide when installing a Western
Digital LAN adapter.

You should not change the factory setting of the LAN adapter if
there are no conflicts with it.  If necessary, it is a simple
matter to change to a different configuration.

The factory settings are: IRQ = 3; I/O Base Address = 280 (hex);
RAM Buffer Base Address = D0000 (hex).  Note that the RAM Buffer
location is determined by the software driver(s) you use, not by
jumpers or other settings on the board itself.

=====================================================================
           SYSTEM RESOURCES USED BY LAN ADAPTER BOARDS
=====================================================================
(1) IRQ - Interrupt Request Channel

Use the chart below to determine which interrupt is best for the
LAN adapter board.  If you cannot find any available interrupt, you
then need to remove or disable something from the system.

Most Western Digital adapters for XT/AT bus systems can select
interrupt 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.  Micro Channel bus adapters can select
interrupt 3, 4, 10, or 15.  Please refer to the User Installation 
Guide that comes with the adapter to determine which interrupts your
LAN adapter can select.

=====================================================================
(2) I/O Base Address

This is a special area in memory used by the computer system to
communicate with devices external to the microprocessor.  These
addresses are always stated in hexadecimal (hex).

Western Digital LAN adapter boards use 32 decimal (20 hex)
consecutive I/O addresses starting at any base address between
200 and 3E0.  If the factory setting of 280 is selected, for
example, the adapter will use addresses 280-29F.

Below is a map of common devices and the I/O ports that they use.

The numbers in the left column are the possible selections for
the LAN adapter I/O Base Address.  If there is something using an
address (for example, if you have a game controller at address
200), then do not locate the LAN adapter at that address.  Any
address can be used as long as something else in the system is not
trying to use the area between that base address and the next one.

  * Factory setting

Any addresses without a description are usually available for use.

Note that computers that have a small built-in LED or LCD display
(to show disk cylinder data or clock speed, for example) might use
certain I/O addresses to interface with that display.

=====================================================================
(3) RAM Buffer - Shared Memory Base Address

RAM buffer memory that resides on Western Digital LAN adapter
boards is used for passing data to and from the adapter.  You must
select an area in your system's memory space above the DOS 640K
boundary where this buffer can reside without conflicting with
RAM or BIOS ROMs located on other add-on boards in your system.

The RAM buffer on a Western Digital LAN adapter can occupy a space
of 8, 16 or 32 Kbytes depending on the type of adapter:

When using a board with a ROM installed, space must be allocated
for both the RAM buffer and the ROM.  Just as with other devices,
the RAM and ROM areas must not conflict with each other.  ROM sizes
can be 16, 32, or 64 Kbytes.

The memory locations for the RAM Buffer are always expressed in
hexadecimal.  640K in hexadecimal is A0000.  This is the first
available location for the RAM Buffer.

Using a base address of D0000 (the default for most Western
Digital software drivers) as an example, here are the ranges of
memory occupied by the LAN adapter RAM buffer:

          8 Kbytes - Would use D0000 through D1FFF
         16 Kbytes - Would use D0000 through D3FFF
         32 Kbytes - Would use D0000 through D7FFF

Below is a map of how the memory space above 640K (A0000) is
used on many computer systems.  Use this as a guide to
determine where to locate the RAM (or ROM) on the LAN adapter.
Remember that the RAM Buffer location is determined by the
software driver(s) you use, not by jumpers or other settings on
the board itself.

  Possible Memory Spaces    Devices That Use Portions     See
      For RAM Buffer           Of This Memory Space       Note
--------------------------------------------------------------
| A0000-AFFFF (Page A)  | EGA on-board video memory      | 1 |
| B0000-B7FFF (Page B0) | Mono on-board video memory     | 1 |
| B8000-BFFFF (Page B8) | RGB and mono video memory      | 1 |
| C0000-C7FFF (Page C0) | EGA BIOS ROM                   | 1 |
| C8000-CFFFF (Page C8) | XT hard disk BIOS ROM          | 1 |
| D0000-DFFFF (Page D)  | Expansion RAM (LIM) area       | 2 |
| E0000-EFFFF (Page E)  | Expansion RAM area and some    | 2 |
|                       |   AT system ROM BIOS           |   |
| F0000-FFFFF (Page F)  | Permanent system ROM BIOS area |   |
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1:  Portions of this memory area are also used by VGA
video boards, but there is considerable variation depending on
the manufacturer.  We recommend setting the RAM Buffer Address
to D0000 or above if an 8-bit VGA is installed.  If you have a 
16-bit VGA installed, there are two options.  The first option
is to convert the 16-bit VGA to 8-bit mode operation and use the
RAM Buffer address of D0000.  The second option is for 16-bit VGA
mode operation.  This option is only operational if the computer
system does not occupy E0000.  Set the RAM Buffer address using
Nwpatch to E0000.  If EGA is installed use the factory setting
of D0000.

Note 2:  Portions of this memory area are used by most memory
expansion boards for page swapping.  This memory area is also
occupy by 16-bit VGA video board, please read note 1.
