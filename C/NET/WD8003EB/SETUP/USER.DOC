       LOCAL AREA NETWORK ADAPTER SETUP PROGRAM

                   USER DOCUMENTATION

Version 1.04                           January 8, 1990


SETUP is a configuration program that operates with the following
adapters:
     - Western Digital WD8003EB EtherCard PLUS adapter
     - Western Digital WD8003W  EtherCard PLUS10T adapter
These adapters contain EEROM memory that eliminates most of the
jumper requirements of earlier adapters, thereby allowing you to 
configure the adapters through software. SETUP is designed to 
support multiple adapters in the same computer, provided they do 
not have the same Base I/O address.  

To run SETUP from a floppy disk, you must first change your 
default drive to the floppy drive (the A drive in the following 
example).  Then run SETUP as follows:

                             A:
                             CD \SETUP
                             SETUP

Or, you can copy the SETUP program files to the system hard disk 
and run SETUP from there.    
           
If you have questions as you use SETUP, HELP screens are 
available from the <F1> function key. Use ESC to exit HELP.  

SETUP can identify other WD LAN adapters in your system, even 
those that are not software configurable adapters. Any Base I/O 
addresses being used by other WD adapters are omitted from the 
list of available choices for the adapter being configured.  

When more than one software configurable adapter is installed, 
you should see all listed, in order, by Base I/O address.  If you 
know you have more than one adapter but only see one listed on 
the display, all of your adapters are probably configured to the 
same Base I/O address.  In this case, you must remove all but one 
adapter from your computer and then change the Base I/O address 
of the remaining one.  Then, you can add a second one to be 
configured.  Refer to the User Installation Guide for additional 
explanation.  
           
When the first character of a list of SETUP program menu choices 
is highlighted, you can type that character to activate that 
choice instead of using the up and down arrows.  
           
The "Automatic Configuration Menu" selects a standard set of 
values for your adapter if there are no conflicts with other 
adapters.  If there are conflicts, you must use the "Basic 
Configuration Menu."

The function key <F8> "Factory setting" sets all the fields on 
the menu (not just the highlighted one) to the configuration they 
had when the adapter left the factory, provided the Base I/O 
address of 240 is not otherwise in use in your machine.  If 240 
is in use, you will have to take the adapter to another computer 
or remove the adapter using 240 before the factory setting can be 
restored.  


    The settings are:              FACTORY       AUTOMATIC
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
        Base I/O address               240             280
        Interrupt Line            Disabled         Enabled
        IRQ Interrupt                    3               3
        Adapter RAM Used                8K              8K
        RAM Base address             D0000           D0000
        6 MHz AT                        NO              NO

        Size/Disable ROM          Disabled              --
        ROM Base Address             D8000              --

    NOTE:    The IRQ interrupt must be enabled separately 
    from selecting its value.  The adapter will not operate 
    until you run the SETUP program and enable the interrupt. 
     
Make sure that the address you select for your network software 
driver matches what you select in SETUP.  Otherwise, your 
driver's address choice at run time will override your setting 
here.  If this happens, the driver might still operate properly, 
but not at the address chosen by the SETUP program. 
           
SETUP attempts to cross check the values you select to look for 
conflicts with other installed hardware and software.  In an AT 
or XT, however, not every possible conflict can be detected.  
SETUP, therefore, provides a Base I/O Address Map in the HELP 
screens and a "RAM Buffer Base Address" table in the User 
Installation Guide to assist you in chosing the proper memory 
locations for your adapter.  

In most cases, if you choose a conflicting value, you need only 
to run SETUP again and choose a different one.  In a few cases, 
such as a conflict with a video controller, you may have to 
remove one of the conflicting adapters.  In this case, moving the 
LAN adapter temporarily to a PC with a different video adapter is 
one alternative.  Another alternative is to use the Clear 
Configuration Jumper as described in Appendix A of the User 
Installation Guide.
