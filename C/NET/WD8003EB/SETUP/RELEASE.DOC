Through normal use the following error messages may occur.    

1. "SYS$ERR.DAT could not be found" or 
   "SYS$HLP.DAT could not be found"
  
If either of these error messages are displayed, the value of the 
FILES parameter in the CONFIG.SYS file may be too small.  Try 
enlarging this value, re-booting, and re-running.  Make sure you 
do not have any network software drivers, such as those for 
ViaNet or NetWare, loaded or active when you are using SETUP.   

2. "Cannot find IBM$RUN.OVL"

If you try to run SETUP on a NetWare workstation, you will see 
this error message.  You should not have the NetWare driver 
loaded when running the SETUP program. 
           
3.  You may encounter problems when chosing the Automatic 
Configuration if you have installed any network software prior to 
running SETUP.  To avoid problems of this nature, remove all 
network drivers and other network software from the system, then 
re-boot and run SETUP.
