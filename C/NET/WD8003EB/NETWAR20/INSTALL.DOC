                         WESTERN DIGITAL
             "PLUS"-FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARD DRIVERS
           FOR USE WITH NOVELL ADVANCED NETWARE v2.0a

                       INSTALLATION GUIDE

This directory provides a single driver for the entire "PLUS" 
(WD8003, WD8013) family of Western Digital LAN adapter boards 
for XT/AT and Micro Channel bus systems.

Included on this directory are the following files:

  INSTALL.DOC           ; This document
  RELEASE.DOC           ; Notes about this release
  INSTALL.BAT           ; Installation batch file
  ASK.COM               ; Program used by INSTALL.BAT
  ACOMDRV.OBJ           ; \
  BCOMDRV.OBJ           ;  \
  CCOMDRV.OBJ           ;   > Server drivers
  DCOMDRV.OBJ           ;  /
  SHELLDRV.OBJ          ; Shell driver

The INSTALL batch file automates the installation of the
Western Digital LAN drivers on the Novell GENOS-1 and GENSH-1
diskettes.  Once the drivers are installed, the GENOS and
GENSH procedures can be run exactly as described in the
Advanced NetWare v2.0a Installation Manuals.

The actions performed by the INSTALL batch file are described
in detail in Appendix B of the NetWare 286 Installation-Part 1
Manual and Chapter 2 of the NetWare 86 Installation Manual.

The GENOS-1 and GENSH diskettes each contain a number of
subdirectories.  Each subdirectory contains the driver for a
specific LAN adapter board.  The INSTALL batch file will
add a subdirectory and the appropriate drivers to both Novell
diskettes.  This procedure is described in Step 2 below.

The GENOS-1 diskette supplied by Novell does not have sufficient
free space to install any more drivers.  Prior to running the
INSTALL batch file, you must therefore delete from GENOS-1
the drivers and subdirectory for one or more LAN adapter types
that are not needed, taking care not to erase the NULL
subdirectory.  This procedure is described in Step 1 below.

Be sure that you make working copies of the NetWare diskettes
as instructed by Chapter 1 of the NetWare Installation
Manuals.  This will preserve your original NetWare diskettes.


STEP 1 -- MAKING ROOM ON THE GENOS-1 DISKETTE

Performing a DIR of the GENOS-1 diskette will reveal that it
contains a number of subdirectories, each containing the
drivers for a different LAN adapter.  The number of these
subdirectories will vary with different versions of NetWare.
There is no room on the diskette to add any more drivers.

To add the Western Digital "PLUS"-family LAN drivers,
select one subdirectory on the GENOS-1 diskette corresponding
to a LAN adapter that you never plan to use.  Delete the driver
files in the selected subdirectory first, and then remove the
subdirectory itself.  The subdirectory names correspond to
LAN adapter boards as follows:

    ASYNC      IBM ASYNC Remote Dial-In Line
    CLUSTER    IBM PC Cluster
    CPRONET    Proteon ProNET With Checksum
    ETHERNET   3COM EtherLink
    GENBIOS    Generic NETBIOS (Interrupt 5Ch)
    GNET       Gateway G/NET
    ISTAR      Novell Star Intelligent NIC
    NESTAR     Nestar PLAN 2000
    NETHER     3COM 3C505 EtherLink Plus
    OMNINET    Corvus Omninet
    PCN        IBM PC Network
    PCNET      Orchid/Santa Clara/AST PCnet
    SMC        SMC/Pure Data ARCNET
    STARLAN    AT&T StarLAN
    TRN        IBM Token Ring
    VISTA      Allen-Bradley VistaLAN/PC

For example, to delete the GNET (Gateway G/NET) driver files
and subdirectory, use the following DOS commands:

          cd \gnet
          erase *.*
          cd \
          rmdir gnet

                            IMPORTANT

Do NOT erase the NULL subdirectory from the GENOS-1 diskette.
This subdirectory is used by the GENOS procedure.


STEP 2 -- RUNNING INSTALL

Place this driver diskette in drive A: and type

                      cd NETWAR20  <Enter>
                      INSTALL  <Enter>

The batch file will lead you through the steps necessary to
add the "PLUS" (WD8003\WD8013) family drivers to both the GENOS-1 
and GENSH-1 diskettes in a new subdirectory named WDPLUS.


STEP 3 -- RUNNING GENOS AND GENSH

Now that the Western Digital LAN drivers have been added to
the GENOS-1 and GENSH-1 diskettes, you are ready to run the
GENOS and GENSH utilities as described in the NetWare 
Installation Manuals.  At the point where you are directed 
to select the LAN driver, the WDPLUS drivers will appear in 
the list of choices as follows:

     DRIVER             MENU CHOICE

     WDPLUS        WD Star/EtherCard PLUS


RAM BUFFER SIZE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION

When generating a server or shell for XT or AT bus adapters, there 
are various configurations that can be selected, one of the parameters 
is the RAM buffer size. There are configuration selections designating 
RAM sizes of 8, 16, and 32 Kbytes of RAM. During shell or server 
initialization the driver adjusts to the adapter once the adapter's 
type and RAM size are determined.

Adapter's with 8 Kbytes of RAM can be used with configuration 
selections which specify 8, 16, or 32 Kbytes of RAM.

Adapter's with 32 Kbytes of RAM must be used with configuration 
selections which specify 32 Kbytes of RAM.
 
WD's AT bus 16 bit adapters can function in two modes, 16 bit mode 
and 8 bit mode. In 16 bit mode, the adapter performs 16 bit data 
transfers and utilizes the full 16 Kbytes of RAM. In 8 bit mode,
the adapter performs 8 bit data transfers and utilizes only 8 
Kbytes of RAM.

To operate the 16 bit adapter in 16 bit mode, place the adapter in a
16 bit bus slot and configure the driver to a configuration selection 
which specifies 16 or 32 Kbytes of RAM.

To operate the 16 bit adapter in 8 bit mode, configure the driver to a
configuration selection which specifies 8 Kbytes of RAM or place the 
adapter in an 8 bit bus slot and specify any driver configuration.
    
			      NOTE

   The drivers "Default" configuration specifies 8 Kbytes RAM and 
   therefore will cause the 16 bit adapter to function in 8 bit mode.  

SERVER DRIVER CONFIGURATION (GENOS)

For adapters that utilize onboard jumpers to select I/O base address, 
interrupt request level (IRQ) and RAM base address, choose configuration 
selections which specify hardware settings that meets your needs. Then 
configure your adapters to match the hardware settings selected.

Software configured adapters include all Micro Channel adapters 
and XT/AT bus adapters which are configured with the SETUP program. For 
these adapters, choose driver configuration selections for the "First", 
"Second", "Third", or "Fourth Software Configured Adapter" based on the 
number of software configured adapters in your server. The driver will 
then read the configuration information directly from the adapter. With 
AT bus adapters the order (first, second, third, fourth) is determined 
by the adapter's I/O Base Address, from lowest to highest. With Micro 
Channel adapters order is determined by the Micro Channel bus slot number 
from lowest to highest. 

                              NOTE

   If your NetWare server contains more than one Micro Channel 
   LAN adapter board, be sure that you manually select a 
   different Interrupt Request (IRQ) channel for each adapter
   before running the Novell GENOS procedure.  To do this, 
   you must use the manual configuration option of the Set 
   Configuration program on your PC system Reference Diskette 
   when you install the boards.


CUSTOM SERVER DRIVER CONFIGURATIONS

If an XT/AT bus server requires some combination of interrupt, I/O Base 
and RAM address that is not offered in one of the configuration choices, 
you can use the NWPATCH1 program to create a custom configuration to meet 
your needs. This patch program is distributed with this driver.

SHELL DRIVER CONFIGURATION (GENSH)

The default shell driver configuration is IRQ=3, I/O Base=280h,
RAM at CA00:0 for 8k. Distributed with this driver is the NWPATCH1 
program which can be used to reconfigure the default shell driver 
configutation. This shell driver has been designed to limit if not 
eliminate the need to reconfigure the ANET3.COM file because you 
have a variety of different WD adapters and hardware configurations 
in your workstations.   

For adapters that utilize onboard jumpers to select I/O base address, 
interrupt request level (IRQ) and RAM base address, use the defualt 
configuration or use NWPATCH1 to reconfigure to hardware settings that 
meets your needs. Then configure your adapter to match the hardware 
settings selected.

Software configured adapters include all Micro Channel adapters and 
XT/AT bus adapters which are configured with the SETUP program. The shell 
driver automatically detects these adapters and reads the configuration 
information directly from the adapter, even if the configuration entry 
selected specified a different I/O base, IRQ, and RAM base. 
 
Therefore, an ANET3.COM file generated for a specific hardware configuration
will function with all adapters set to that particular hardware setting. Plus 
it will function with all Micro Channel and XT/AT bus software configured 
adapters because the shell driver reads the configuration information 
directly from the adapter.  

STARLAN CONFIGURABILITY

This driver (both server and shell) when used with WD StarCard PLUS 
adapter family is default configured to use the same packet protocol used 
by the Novell StarLAN driver for AT&T StarLAN adapters. This maintains 
compatibility in a network with AT&T adapters using the Novell driver. 
This packet protocol limits the maximum packet size to 512 bytes and will 
not function if packets are routed across a non-Novell bridge.

The drivers may be reconfigured using the NWPATCH1 program, to use the
standard 802.3 packet protocol with a maximum packet size of 1024 bytes.
If your network requires that you route packets across a non-Novell 
bridge you MUST reconfigure your drivers to the 802.3 packet protocol.
If your network uses only WD StarLAN adapters you can reconfigure your 
drivers to take advantage of increased driver performance due to the 
increased maximum packet size. Remember, when changing the packet protocol
both the server and workstation drivers must be reconfigured.   
