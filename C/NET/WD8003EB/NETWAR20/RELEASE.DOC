                         WESTERN DIGITAL
             "PLUS" FAMILY LAN ADAPTER BOARD DRIVERS
            FOR USE WITH NOVELL ADVANCED NETWARE v2.0a

                       RELEASE INFORMATION

             Version 3.04         13 December 1989


This Western Digital driver for Novell Advanced NetWare, SFT 
NetWare and ELS NetWare Level I, v2.0a versions has been tested 
by Western Digital and certified by Novell.


VERSION HISTORY

-- Version 3.04 (Current Version, December 1989) --

With this release of the driver new functions have been added to 
increase the drivers flexibility and some old problems have been fixed. 
This driver supports the entire Star/EtherCard PLUS and EtherCard PLUS16
family of LAN adapters.

In this release the driver will read the configuration information
directly from registers in software configured XT/AT bus adapters
(currently WD8003EB & WD8003W) in the same fashion that Micro Channel
adapters have been configured in the past. This "Auto Configuration" 
feature will eliminate the need to reconfigure the driver to match
different adapter configurations.

When using StarLAN adapters this driver can be configured to use either 
the Novell StarLAN driver compatible packet format (AT&T StarLAN compatible) 
or the standard IEEE 802.3 packet format.  

More information about these features as well as tips on how to best
utilize them can be found in the file INSTALL.DOC.

This driver contains fixes for two problems which existed in previous 
drivers, including the Novell certified v2.09 driver. Problem 1; A 
workstation problem, had to do with the IPX call to CancelRequest and 
occurred only in certain NetBIOS applications which call this IPX function. 
Problem 2; Occurred only on certain adapter revsions when under high 
load situations. This problem would cause the server to "lock up" or get 
a GPI interrupt.
 
-- Version 3.02 (September 1989) --

This release provides support for the EtherCard PLUS16 adapter.
It contains a completely new driver configuration table to support 
adapters with 8, 16, and 32 Kbytes of RAM. The default configuration
has changed to IRQ 3, Base I/O 280, RAM at CA00:0 for 8K.

There is one known problem with this driver, Configuration 12 (IRQ=2,
I/O Base=220, RAM at C000:0 for 32K) will NOT function with Ethercard PLUS16
in the file server.  

NOTE: This driver has been tested by Western Digital and distrubuted 
on a limited basis. 

-- Version 2.09 (November 1988) --

Changes were made to meet Novell certification requirements.
There were no problems reported by any users with the previous
version.


-- Version 2.08 (June/September 1988) --

The server driver and the shell drivers now operate with 
Ethernet and StarLAN Micro Channel bus adapters as well as 
with XT/AT bus adapters.  Problems were fixed that:

     o prevented interoperation with Ethernet adapters
       from certain other manufacturers

     o caused workstations to stop when receiving certain
       queries from Novell Diagnostic Utilities


-- Version 2.07 (June 1988) --

An error in one configuration table entry has been corrected.


-- Version 2.06  (May 1988) --

Two problems that were present in driver version 2.05 have been 
corrected:

     o A server or workstation would occasionally stop 
       functioning when the network was under extremely
       heavy load.

     o Certain application programs that used the Novell
       NETBIOS interface would not operate properly.

The following improvements have been made:

     o The RAM base address in the workstation shell is
       changed from C4000 (hex) to D0000 to minimize conflicts
       with other adapters (especially VGA, EGA).

     o The driver operates with LAN adapter boards that have
       32 Kbyte RAM buffers as well as the original adapter
       boards with 8 Kbyte RAM buffers.

     o Workstation transmit speeds are improved.
