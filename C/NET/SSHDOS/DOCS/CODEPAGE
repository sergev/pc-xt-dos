This document describes how to use ISO Latin characters
with SSHDOS.

You'll need SSHDOS v0.9 or later and ISO Latin fonts
and keymaps which are available here:
http://www.kostis.net/freeware/isocp101.zip

Download the isocp package and extract it. Read it's
documentation and be sure which keymap TSR and special
codepage number you need. Copy the proper keymap TSR
program and the isolatin.cpi file to your DOS directory.

Add this line to your config.sys:

	device=c:\dos\display.sys con=(ega,xxx,2)

where xxx is the DOS codepage you normally use (850 for Western Europe).
Add the following lines to your autoexec.bat to prepare the code
page switch:

	mode con cp prepare=((xxx)c:\dos\yyyy.cpi)
	mode con cp select=xxx
	keyb zz

where xxx is the DOS codepage you normally use, yyyy is the proper
ega, ega2 or ega3 CPI file for your codepage and zz is your
country code.

Now we switch to the latin codepage by running these commands:

	isokbxxx.com
	mode con cp prepare=((yyy)c:\dos\isolatin.cpi)
	mode con cp select=yyy
	isokbxxx.com /a

where isokbxxx.com is the one you copied to the DOS directory
from the isocp package and yyy is your special codepage number,
based on the isocp documentation (819 for ISO latin 1).

Connect to your host with SSHDOS and be sure that 8 bit
characters are enabled. For example in BASH, you must include
this in your .inputrc:

	set input-meta On
	set output-meta On
	set convert-meta Off

Disconnect, reconnect and have fun :)

Bye,

Daniel
