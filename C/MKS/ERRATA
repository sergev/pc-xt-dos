INSTALLATION MANUAL

- In several places the Installation Manual mentions that when a file
  is overwritten with a new file, the old version is saved with a .mks
  extension.  This behavior has been extended.  When another file with
  the same name is saved, the .mks file is saved with the .mk0 file extension.
  As subsequent files with this name are saved, the .mk0 extension changes
  to .mk1, then .mk2 through .mk9.

         co;2;respawn;$ROOTDIR/bin/sh.exe

- Page 33 APPENDICES: Section 1.1.3 With Configuration 4:

USER'S GUIDE

- Page 65 Awk Tutorial: Introduction:

        The manual states that a book entitled The Awk Programming Language 
        is included in the MKS AWK package.  This book is not included with 
        MKS Toolkit.

- Page 96 AWK Tutorial: 5.2 The if Statement:

       An if statement is an action of the form 
                if (expression) statement1 else statement2

  Note: When the else statemant2 part of the if statement is on the same 
  line as the statement1, the else statement2 should be separated from the 
  statement1 by a semicolon (;).

- Page 97 AWK Tutorial: Please add:
  Remember that \t is the escape sequence for a tab character.

- Page 93 cd(1): NOTE section:

        Please add: The external version of cd has no effect when run from 
                    the shell.

- Page 44 alias(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        Please delete last line: chdir is not a known alias for cd.

- Page 105 compress(1): DESCRIPTION section, 2nd paragraph:

	The last sentence should read:

	If the .Z file already exists, compress gives an error and asks you
	whether or not it should overwrite the existing file, unless you
	specified the -f option.

	The 3rd paragraph should start off:

	On DOS and OS/2 systems, that use the FAT (File Allocation Table)
	file system, compress writes ...

- Page 113 cpio(1): NOTE section:

        Please add: If you are extracting files under DOS and OS/2, to 
                    a FAT (File Allocation Table) system, truncation 
                    will occur.
 
- Page 120 ctags(1): PORTABILITY section:

	The -w option is also an MKS extension to the POSIX standard.

- Page 123, 124 date(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        The descriptions of some of the special format fields are 
        inaccurate.  Make the following changes:

	%d   the two-digit day of the month as a number (01-31)
	%s   the seconds (00 to 61). Note that there is an allowance for 
             2 leap seconds.
	%t   represents a tab character (not a synonym for %T)
	%z   a synonym for %Z

- Page 125 date(1): EXAMPLES section: 

        Please complete this section by adding the following:

	... produces the date in the default format, as shown at the
	top of this man page.

- Page 145 diff(1): DESCRIPTION section: 

        The -s option is not documented. This option compares two 
        directories, file by file, and prints messages for identical files 
        between directories.

        Last paragraph should say the default is 3999.

- Page 146 diff(1): PORTABILITY section: 

        The -B option is also an MKS extension to the POSIX standard.

- Page 166 ex(1): new NOTE section:

        ex is documented, but not installed as part of the normal Toolkit.
        Since the vi program usually runs as a full screen editor, you can    
        copy vi.exe to ex.exe, and then use ex as a line-oriented editor.

- Page 153 echo(1): DESCRIPTION section: 

        The \c option should read:

        	\c  removes any following characters including \n and \r

- Page 153 echo(1):  PORTABILITY section, 4th paragraph:

	This section may appear to refer to the patch(1) command.
	Actually, it refers to the `patch.bat' file which has
	historically been provided in MKS Toolkit.  It will modify
	command.com to remove the built-in utilities CD, DATE, TIME,
	ECHO, MKDIR, RMDIR. The purpose of this is to make the MKS
	utilities (cd, date, time, echo, mkdir, and rmdir) available to
	command.com users.

	`patch.bat' may be found on the first MKS Toolkit distribution
	diskette.

- Page 196 getopts(1): PORTABILITY section:

        The second paragraph should read:

	On UNIX systems, getopts is built into both the KornShell and
	Bourne Shell.

- Page 203 head(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        The description of the -b option is incorrect.  It should read:

	-b num	displays the first num*512 bytes of each file

        The synopsis shows a -k option, but there is no entry in the 
        DESCRIPTION section.  The description should read:

	-k num	displays the first num*1024 bytes of each file

        The last example given in the DESCRIPTION section, regarding 
        option characters as modifiers, is incorrect.  It uses an old 
        syntax for head(1) that is no longer supported.  The example 
        will be removed in the next printing of the reference manual.

- Page 216 join(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        Please add a space between the -t option and its c argument.
 
- Page 228 ls(1): DESCRIPTION section:
 
        Description of -f option should read:

       -f   enables the -a option and disables the -C option.
            This means that for each argument which is a 
            directory, all directory entries are listed in the 
            same order as retrieved from the system. 

- Page 255 mailx(1): ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section:

	indent and indentprefix are synonymous. If both indent and 
        indentprefix are set, indentprefix takes precedence.

- Page 260 man(1): ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section:

	TMPDIR identifies the directory where temporary files reside.

- Page 272 nm(1): SYNOPSIS section:

        The synopsis describes -A and -v options.  Neither option
	is part of MKS Toolkit for DOS.  The -A option is a duplicate of
	the -o option.  The -v option is the same as the -n option.

- Page 284 patch(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        The last sentence of the third paragraph should read: 

        If only one of the files exists, patch patches that file; if        
        neither exists or both do, patch checks for a line starting
        with a string Index: before asking you for the name of the
        file to patch.

- Page 293 pax(1): NOTE section:

        Please add:

	If you are extracting files under DOS and OS/2, to a FAT (File
	Allocation Table) system, truncation will occur.

- Page 298 pg(1): ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section:

        TEMPDIR should be TMPDIR.

- Page 322 sed(1): new LIMITS section includes the following:

	sed allows a limit of 1024 bytes per line and 28,000 lines per
        file. It does not allow the NUL character. The maximum length
        of a global command is 256 characters, including newlines.

- Page 329 sh(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        Add the -T flag:

	Disable the shell's timer interrupt.  This can be used when a
	program causes a TSR to enable a timer interrupt, which would be
	disabled when the shell exits.  The only use for this is Sun's
	PC-NFS "net start rdr" command in a shell script.

- Page 330 sh(1): 

       First sentence at top of page should read:

       In addition to these options, you can use any valid sh(1) option
       to the set command (including -o option) as a command line option
       to sh.

- Page 334 sh(1): 

        Remove the last line:

        On OS/2, any such file is passed to cmd.exe and executed as an
        OS/2 batch file.

- Page 340 sh(1): Summary of Operators Table:

        Under the heading `Assignment Operator,' the word `assignment' 
        appears to be included in the list of operators.  This is a 
        formatting error.  The word belongs in the right hand half of 
        the table, under `logical or'.

- Page 378 tar(1): NOTES section:

        Please add:

	If you are extracting files under DOS and OS/2, to a FAT (File
	Allocation Table) system, truncation will occur.

- Page 383 time(1): NOTE section:

        Please add:

	OS/2 has no external time command.

- Page 388 tr(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        Please change [c1-c2] to c1-c2 
        Also change the example filter from tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]' 
        to tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

- Page 396 typeset(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        -R[number] option, should read:

	right ... the start (not end) of the value as necessary. ...

- Page 400 uname(1): PORTABILITY section, should read:

        ... Under the DOS compatibility box, the release is equal to that
        of OS/2; the version is equal to the OS/2 version multiplied by
        10. ...

- Page 401 uncompress(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        Please add the following paragraph between the second and third:

        On DOS and OS/2 (using a FAT file system), compressed files typically
        do not end in .Z and are uncompressed in place.

- Page 406 unpack(1): DIAGNOSTICS section:

        The example for an exit status of n should read:

        For example, if three out of six files could not be unpacked
        properly, the exit status is 3.

- Page 406 unpack(1): The ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section should be removed.

	The FILES section describes the correct behavior for unpack
	temporary files.

- Page 414 vi (1): DESCRIPTION section:

        Add the -r option:

        -r    tries to recover all specified files after a system or
              editor crash. If you do not specify any files, vi displays
              a list of all recoverable files. 

- Page 421 vi(1): DESCRIPTION section:

        The description of the `I' command should read:

	Enter insert mode before the first non-blank character on line.
