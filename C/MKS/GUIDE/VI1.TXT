Little Miss Muffet
Sat on her tuffet
Eating her curds and whey
Along came a spider
That sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

Little Jack Horner
Sat in the corner
Eating his Christmas pie
He stuck in his thumb
And pulled out a plum
And said, "What a good boy am I!"

Old Mother Hubbard
Went to the cupboard
To get her poor dog a bone
But when she got there
The cupboard was bare
And so her poor doggie had none.

'Twas brillig and the slithey toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsey were the borogroves
And the mome raths outgrabe.
