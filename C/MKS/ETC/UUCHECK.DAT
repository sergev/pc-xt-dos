# uucheck.dat - uucp system integrity check data file
#
#
#	This file should reside in ROOTDIR/etc
#
#
#	This file defines the required uucp system files.  This list is read
#	by the uucheck utility when it is executed to perform an integrity
#	check of the installed uucp system.
#
#
#	FILE FORMAT:
#
#		Data lines must start with 'D', 'F', 'N', where:
#
#			'D' -	File must exist and be a directory, else
#				uucheck reports
#				"Missing"
#
#			'F' -	File must exist, else uucheck reports
#				"Missing"
#
#			'N' -	File must not exist, else uucheck reports
#				"Found"
#
#
#		The key letter is separated with a single space or tab from
#		the pathname of the file to check.  This filename is considered
#		relative to the ROOTDIR environment variable.  This means that
#		if the ROOTDIR enviromnent variable in your installation is set
#		to "C:", then F/bin/mksos.com would be interpreted to mean
#		that "C:/bin/mksos.com" must exist or a warning "Missing"
#		message will be issued when uucheck is executed.
#
#		Lines starting with any other character other than 'D', 'F'
#		or 'N', or blank lines will be treated as comment lines and
#		ignored.
#
#		A data line may include a comment by following the filename
#		with a space or tab and the text of your comment.
