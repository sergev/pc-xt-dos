To install IBM FORTRAN/2, place the FORTRAN "INSTALL" Master Diskette in a
diskette drive and enter:

   n:INSTALL

where n is the letter of the drive containing the diskette.

Respond to the questions that follow in order to complete the installation.

Make sure your "PATH" statement includes the location of "LINK.EXE", and that
"APPEND" does not point to any existing directories containing IBM FORTRAN/2
files.	To disable "APPEND", type "APPEND=;".

If you get the message "Link : warning L4051: FORTRAN.LIB : cannot find
library" and select only the emulation library during installation, you must
use the /N option for compilation. For more information, see "Choice of
Libraries" under "Installation Prompts" in the "Compile, Link and Run" manual.
