                    	 INTRODUCTION 	

MicroCalc is a tiny spreadsheet program "a la MultiPlan". It is provided
with the Turbo Basic system as an example program.

Since MicroCalc is only a demonstration program, it has its limitations
(which you may have fun eliminating) :

  * You can not copy formulas from one cell to others.
  * You can not insert and delete lines or columns.

In spite of its limitations MicroCalc does provide some interesting
features among which are:

  *  Full set of mathematical functions (SIN,COS,LN,EXP, etc...)
  *  Built in line editor for text and formula editing.
  *  Text can be entered across cells.
  *  Once entered a formula is protected from accidental erasure.
  *  DOS acces
  *  Color cells

In addition to this, MicroCalc offers all the usual features of a
spreadsheet program:

  *  Load a spreadsheet from the disk.
  *  Save a spreadsheet on the disk.
  *  Print the spreadsheet on the printer (or to a file)
  *  Automatic recalculation after each entry (May be disabled).
  *  Init (Clears) the current spreadsheet.

Note :

The spreadsheet is like an electronic piece of paper on which you can
enter text, numbers and formulas and have MicroCalc to do calculations
automatically. The cells are the intersections between lines and columns.

             ( The next page shows the Spread Sheet ... )
.PA
This is the electronic spreadsheet :

	          A         B         C         D         E        F        G    	
	 1	    22.45
	 2	     1.00
	 3	     2.00
	 4	     3.00
	 5	 	   28.45

[A5,Formula]       type / for Commands,   F2 For Edit    AutoCalc is ON
(A1+A2+A3+A4)
	                                                                         	

Cells are denoted A1 through G21 giving a total of 147 cells.

In the example the next last line shows that the active cell is cell A5,
and that A5 contains a Formula : (A1+A2+A3+A4) which means that the
numbers in A1,A2,A3 and A4 should be added and placed in A5.

The formula can be abbreviated to : (A1>A4) (add all cells from A1 to A4).
.PA
You move the cursor around just like you do with the Turbo Basic editor :

                             (Up)
                            Ctrl-E
                (Left) Ctrl-S     Ctrl-G (Right)
                            Ctrl-X
                            (Down)

        ( On the IBM-PC you may also use the arrow keys. )

A cell may contain a number, a formula or some text. The type of the cell
and its coordinates are shown in the bottom left corner of the screen:

[A5,Formula]          Means that the current cell is A5 and that it
                      contains a formula.

[A1,Text]             Cell A1 contains text.

[A2,Numeric]          Cell A2 contains a number.

                     	 Summary of MicroCalc functions 	


Summary of standard functions and operators:
ABS, SQRT, SQR, SIN, COS, ARCTAN, LN, LOG, EXP, INT, SGN, FACT (factorial)
+,-,*,/ and ^ to raise to any power : e.g. 2^3 = 8
Furthermore the operator '>' can be used to denote a range of cells to add.

Entering data
To enter data in any field move the cursor to the cell and enter the
data. MicroCalc automatically determines if the cell is numeric or a
a text cell. Cell beginning with + - ( . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 is numeric.

When moving between cells:
^S,^D,^E,^X move left, right, up, and down.

When editing a cell
Tab Left,Tab Right moves left and right. ^A,^F moves to begin/end of line
^G or DEL deletes left or right character.
^V or Ins changes between insert/overwrite mode.
F2 to edit an existing cell. ESC makes it possible to regret changes

                    	 COMMANDS OF MicroCalc 	
The commands are available when you strike the / character :

   A  switches Autocalc ON and OFF
   B  switches Border ON and OFF
   C  to change cell Color
   D  acces to Dos (or execute a DOS commands)
   F  to change the output Format for numbers
      Note: to use scientific notation enter -1 for the number of decimals
   G  to Goto a specified cell
   H  the Help screens
   I  to Init (clear) the SpreadSheet
   L  to Load a spreadsheet from the disk
   P  to Print the spreadsheet to the printer (or a file)
   Q  to Quit MicroCalc
   R  to Recalculate the Spread Sheet
   S  to Save a Spread Sheet on the disk.
   U  to Update (to restore) the screen

To edit a cell content : Simply move to the cell and press F2 key,
make your changes and press RETURN key (or press ESC to cancel).
.PA

                             	 EXAMPLES 	

The following are examples of valid cell formulas:

(A1+(B2-C7))  subtract cell C7 from B2 and add the result to cell A1
(A1>A21)      the sum of cells  A1,A2,A3..A21
(A1>B2)       the sum of cells  A1,A2, B1,B2

The formulas may be as complicated as you want :

(SIN(A1)*COS(A2)/((1.2*A8)+LN(FACT(A8)+8.9E-3))+(C1>C5))


To try MicroCalc, now use the L command to Load the file MCDEMO


Note : If you run MicroCalc with a FileName parameter, this File will be
       loaded automatically : (e.g.  MC mcdemo).
