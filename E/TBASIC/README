
   You own the "OEM" version, or "bundled" version of Turbo Basic.
   The software included is exactly the same software you can buy
   in a retail store. The only difference in the product you own 
   is that you have a subset of the full documentation normally 
   provided with the retail product.

               numbers of any additional hardware.

           d)  Operating system and version number.  (The version
               number can be determined by typing VER at the DOS
               prompt.)

           e)  Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

           f)  Contents of your CONFIG.SYS file.



    2.  NEW GRAPHICS MODE SUPPORT FOR IBM PS/2
    ------------------------------------------

    Turbo Basic supports the new enhanced graphics modes
    available on the new IBM Personal System/2 computers.

    You'll use the SCREEN statement to switch graphics modes.
    The following table describes the new modes the SCREEN
    statement supports:


       SCREEN     MODE
       -------------------------------------------------------
       11         640 X 480  Black and White (all PS/2 models)
       12         640 X 480  16 Color (models 50,60,80 only)



    3.  NEW HERCULES GRAPHICS MODE SUPPORT
    --------------------------------------

    Turbo Basic now supports the Hercules Graphics Card and
    Hercules Graphics Card Plus.  In order to activate this
    graphics mode you use the screen statement:

        SCREEN 2

    On the Hercules adapter, this will put your program in 720 x
    348 graphics mode.  RamFont is not supported in the Hercules
    Graphics Card Plus.



    4.  THE MESSAGE WINDOW
    ----------------------

    While you are compiling a program, the message window
    now displays the time the compiler has taken to compile
    your program in addition to the memory currently available
    for compilation.


    5.  PROMPT FOR INCLUDE FILES
    ----------------------------

    The compiler will now prompt the programmer to insert another
    floppy disk if a program attempts to include a file that
    cannot be found on the default drive.  This allows
    compilation of large programs on single or dual floppy disk
    systems, in particular, when the program's source code won't
    fit on one or two floppy disks.

    The following steps show one way to compile large programs
    on floppy disk systems:

      1.  Load Turbo Basic from drive A: and remove the Turbo Basic
          disk.
      2.  Insert a disk in drive A: with the main source file for
          your Turbo Basic program on it.
      3.  Set the Main file in the File pulldown menu to the name
          of your Turbo Basic program.
      4.  Set the Executable directory in the Setup\Directories
          menu to A: so the .EXE file will be written to A:
      5.  Put the first floppy disk with your include files on it
          into drive B:
      6.  Change the default drive to drive B: with the Change dir
          selection in the File pulldown menu.
      7.  Set Compile to .EXE in the Options\Compile to menu.
      8.  Compile the program.
      9.  If Turbo Basic cannot find an include file, it will
          prompt you to insert a disk with the file on it. When
          you insert this disk, put it in drive B:

    The resulting .EXE file will be on drive A.


    6.  CORRECTIONS/ADDITIONS TO THE HANDBOOK
    -----------------------------------------

    The following lists the corrections and additions to the
    Turbo Basic handbook.  They are arranged by page number so you
    can easily update your handbook while you read through them.

    Page 185 - The syntax of the DIM statement should include
    brackets, like so:

         DIM [{STATIC|DYNAMIC}] var (subscripts)...

    Page 274 - The first sentence in the Remarks section should be:

       n is the trapped key, and integer expression from 1-25,
       30, or 31, according to the following:

    Page 287 - In the example section, change the following from

       IF LOF(1) > 0 THEN

       to

       IF LOC(1) > 0 THEN

       and change

       ComPortInput$(0) = INPUT$(LOF(1), #1)

       to

       ComPortInput$(0) = INPUT$(LOC(1), #1)

    Page 333 - In the Remarks section, mode is an integer
    expression ranging from 0 to 12, not 10.

    Page 355 - In the sixth paragraph, a procedure definition
    must be terminated with an END SUB, not an END DEF.

    Page 401 - The original assembly language source code for the
    INLINE procedure on this page follows:

       program segment ; begin program segment
         assume cs:program

         push BP         ; save the Base Pointer
         mov  BP,SP      ; move stack pointer to BP
         les  DI,[BP+6]  ; offset address of parameter
         mov  AX, 64h    ; constant to fill
         mov  CX, C8h    ; length of fill
         cld             ; clear the direction flag
         rep             ; fill the words
         stosw
         pop  BP         ; restore Base Pointer

       program ends  ; end program segment
       ends          ; end compilation


    Note that there is no RET at the end of the routine.  You may
    run this code through The MicroSoft Assembler to generate the
    code listed in the handbook.

    Page 415 - Under runtime errors, #74 should not include
    renaming across directories.

    Page 416 - Add this error message:

       201  You have run out of stack space.  You can either
       increase the stack space available with the $STACK
       metastatement or reduce the amount of recursion being done
       by recursive procedures and functions.

    Page 425 - Add to the compiler errors:

       500 CLEAR not allowed here. CLEAR is illegal within a
       procedure or defined function.



    7.  IMPORTANT TIPS
    ------------------

    CTRL-BREAK - If you want to be able to use CTRL-BREAK when
    running a program, toggle ON the Keyboard break option in the
    Options pulldown menu before compiling/running your program.
    Note that CTRL-BREAK will only interrupt your program if the
    Keyboard break option is turned ON and your program is doing
    screen I/O or you have turned the Trace option ON in the
    Debug menu.  This is important to note because many public
    domain programs written for BASICA do not provide any way
    for the user to terminate execution other than pressing
    CTRL-BREAK.

    PRINT USING - When using the PRINT USING statement to display
    real numbers (single and double precision), you may find that
    the format strings for your BASICA programs do not format the
    numeric values correctly.  One symptom may be that your
    numbers are displayed with a preceding % character followed
    by the number.  This is because Turbo Basic provides 80 bits
    of numeric precision compared to BASICA's 24 bits.  In other
    words, you have proportionately more-significant digits for
    all of your numbers.  Consequently, you may have to make more
    room for your numbers when you output them.

    We have also found that some versions of GW BASIC
    automatically remove the last character of a number when
    there isn't enough room in the format string to display a
    negative sign.  BASICA does not do this, nor does Turbo Basic.
    If you need to display a negative sign, you must allow for it
    in the PRINT USING statement's format string.
