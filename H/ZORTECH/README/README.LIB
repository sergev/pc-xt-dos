This is version 3.0.

Zortech has a policy of continuous improvement to our products. This 
means that changes will have been made since completion of the documentation.
This file contains details of new functions added to the standard libraries.
-----------------------------------
Version : V3.0r4 Release
Date	: October 15, 1991

-----------------------------------
New Library functions supported in this release.
-----------------------------------
alloca

    Usage

	#include <stdlib.h>
	void __ss *alloca(size_t size);

    Description

	alloca() provides an efficient way to allocate a
	temporary amount of storage within the current
	stack frame. No corresponding free function is
	necessary, since the stack frame is discarded when
	the function returns. This means that a pointer to
	an alloca'd buffer cannot be returned from a function.

	alloca() is implemented as a compiler intrinsic,
	that is, the compiler recognizes it and performs
	special action to support it. This means that you
	should never define your own alloca function. It also
	means that alloca() is reliable.

	alloca() cannot be used in functions that have the
	Windows prolog/epilog in them, i.e. functions compiled
	with the -W flag.

    Example

    Return Value

	Returns NULL if an error occurred. Otherwise, returns
	a pointer into the current stack frame of the allocated
	data.

	Although a stack-relative pointer is returned, this is
	usually implicitly cast by the compiler into the correct
	pointer type.

    See Also

	malloc, free

    Compatibility

	alloca() works across all Zortech implementations. It,
	however, is not an ANSI C function. The implementation
	quality of it varies considerably from compiler to
	compiler, and is not even implemented by many compilers.
-----------------------------------
_beginthread

    Usage

	#include <process.h>
	int _beginthread(void (_far *thread_func)(void _far *),
		void _far *stack_buf, unsigned stack_size,
		void _far *argument);

    Description

	Starts execution of a new thread starting at the
	function thread_func. stack_buf is the address of
	a memory buffer to be used as a stack by the thread.
	stack_buf must be word aligned for 16 bit compiles,
	and dword aligned for 32 bit compiles.
	stack_size gives the size of that buffer, at least
	2048 bytes. If stack_buf is NULL, the _beginthread()
	will malloc a buffer for the stack.

	argument is a 32 bit value to be passed to thread_func.
	It is usually a pointer to the data that the thread function
	is to operate on.

	The thread is terminated by a call to _endthread() within
	thread_func, or by the return from thread_func. A thread
	created by _beginthread() must not be terminated by
	a call to the OS/2 function DosExit().

	It is necessary to use _beginthread()/_endthread() to start
	and end threads whenever those threads will call routines
	in the runtime library. These functions ensure that the
	library routines are properly synchronized.

    Example

    Return Value

	If successful, returns the thread id of the created thread.
	Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set.

	_endthread

    Compatibility

	Multithreaded programming is currently only supported
	under OS/2.
-----------------------------------
_endthread

    Usage

	#include <process.h>
	void _endthread(void);

    Description

	Terminates execution of a thread that was started
	by _beginthread().

    Example

    Return Value

	None.

    See Also

	_beginthread

    Compatibility

	Multithreaded programming is currently only supported
	under OS/2.
-----------------------------------
_msize

    Usage

	#include <stdlib.h>
	size_t _msize(void *p);

    Description

	Returns actual size of a block of memory allocated
	by malloc/calloc/realloc.
	This is implemented as a macro.

    Example

    Return Value

	Size in bytes of block of memory.

	malloc, calloc, realloc
