INTRODUCTION
This document corrects some errors in the Zortech C++ documentation set.
It has three parts:

	o UPDATES includes new information about Zortech C++ that 
	  wasn't included in the manuals.
	o THE BLINK COMMAND corrects some mistakes in Chapter 3,
	  "Linking Applications," of the Window Programming Tools 
	  manual about the BLINK command.
	o THE QUICK REFERENCE CARD corrects some mistakes on the 
	  Quick Reference Card for Microsoft Windows 3.0.

-----------------------------------
UPDATES
This section includes new information about Zortech C++ that wasn't 
included in the manuals.


The Developer's Edition

The manuals refer to the version of Zortech C++ that does not contain the
Numerics Programming Guide or the M++ Library as the Developer's Edition. 
That's the old name of that version. It is now called, simply, Zortech C++. 
The version that does contain the Numerics Programming Guide and the M++
Class Library is still called the Engineering and Science Edition.
-----------------------------------
THE BLINK COMMAND
This correction corrects some information in Chapter 3, "Linking 
Applications," of the Window Programming Tools manual about the BLINK 
command.


Here is some general information:

o Each application can have only one .RES file.

o The sample command lines are incorrect. The following command 
  lines link the application object file SAMPLE.OBJ with the 
  standard Windows library LIBW.LIB:

	BLINK SAMPLE.OBJ, SAMPLE.EXE, SAMPLE.MAP,, SAMPLE.DEF, SAMPLE.RES

	BLINK SAMPLE, SAMPLE, SAMPLE,, SAMPLE, SAMPLE

  Notice that in each example there are two commas after the 
  map-file argument.


Here are options BLINK does not accept:

o /pause
o /segments
o /warmfixup


Here are options you may use when linking, despite the warning on page 37:

o /nogroupassociation
o /disallocate
o /high		


Here is corrected documentation for some options:

o /alignment:size
	There's no need to set the alignment to 16 or less (or 
	to 32 or less for applications over one megabyte).

o /codeview
        Lets you use any codeview compatible debugger.


These are switches that BLINK accepts that weren't included in the manual.
These are similar to options for the ZRC command:

o /ems  For a dynamic link library, changes the default location
	of global memory from below the EMS bank line to above 
	the EMS bank line.

	The minimum abbreviation for this option is /em.

o /k	Disables the load-optimization feature of BLINK (?). If 
	this option is not specified the compiler arranges 
	segments and resources in the executable file so that 
	all preloaded information is contiguous. This feature 
	allows Windows to load the application much more quickly.

	If you do not specify the /K option, all data segments, 
	nodiscardable code segments, and the entry-point code 
	segment will be preloaded, unless any segment and its 
        relocation information exceed 64K. If the PRELOAD
	attribute is not assigned to these segments in the 
	module-definition (.DEF) file when you link your 
	application, the compiler will add the preload attribute 
	and display a warning. Resources and segments will have 
        the same segment alignment. This alignment should be as
	small as possible to prevent the final executable file 
	from growing unnecessarily large. you can set the 
	alignment using the /alignment option.

o /lim32	
	Tells Windows that the application uses expanded memory 
        directly according to the Lotus Intel Microsoft
	Expanded Memory Specification (EMS), version 2.2. 

	The minimum abbreviation for this option is /l.

o /multinst
	When Windows is running with the EMS 4.0 memory 
	configuration, this switch assigns each instance of the 
	application task to a distinct EMS bank. (By default, 
	all instances of a task share the same EMS bank.)

	The minimum abbreviation for this option is /mu.

o /t	Creates an application that runs only with Windows in 
	protected (standard or 386 enhanced) mode. If the user 
	attempts to run the application in read mode, Windows 
	will display a message box telling the user that the 
	application cannot run in real mode.

THE QUICK REFERENCE CARD
Under "Combobox Messages" in the "Control Class Messages" 
section, you should add CB_ERR.
