DEFINITION MODULE SLongIO;
(* Input and output of long real numbers in decimal text form using default
   channels.
   The read result is of the type IOConsts.ReadResults.
*)

(* The text form of a signed fixed-point real number is
     ["+"|"-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}, [".", {decimal digit}] *)

(* The text form of a signed floating-point real number is
     signed fixed-point real number,
     "E", ["+"|"-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit} *)

PROCEDURE ReadReal (VAR long : LONGREAL);
(* Skips leading spaces and removes any remaining characters
   that form part of a signed fixed or floating point number.
   A corresponding value is assigned to the parameter long.
   The read result is set to the value allRight, outOfRange, wrongFormat,
   endOfLine, or endOfInput. *)

(* Writes the value of the parameter long in floating-point text form
   with sigFigs significant figures in a field of the given minimum width. *)

(* As for WriteFloat except that the number is scaled with one to
   three digits in the whole number part and with an exponent that is
   a multiple of three. *)

(* Writes the value of the parameter long in fixed-point text form,
   rounded to the given place relative to the decimal point,
   in a field of the given minimum width. *)

PROCEDURE WriteReal (long  : LONGREAL;
                     width : CARDINAL);
(* Writes the value of long as WriteFixed if the sign and magnitude
   can be shown in the given width, otherwise as WriteFloat.
   The number of places or significant digits depend on the given width. *)
