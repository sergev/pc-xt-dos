Gardens Point Modula - IBM PC & compatibles version of 15 July 1994
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The PC version of the Gardens Point Modula compiler (gpm) is comprised of the
following files. 
Copy the following files to your floppy disk:

                GPMPCxxx.zip     <- main distribution file
                install.com      <- installation program files
                ~~~~~.com
                ~~~~.com
                ~~~.com
                unzip.exe        <- unarchiving utility

Running install from the floppy disk will install GPM onto your hard disk.
Install will create a sub directory on the hard disk nominated and copy the
relevant files.  Install will also update your autoexec.bat file to include
some environment variables used by GPM.

This package uses the MS-DOS editor EDIT as the default editor.   NOTE:  This
editor comes standard with all versions of DOS from 5.0 onwards.  To use other 
editors (PC-Write, QEdit) see either the notes in the file README.TOO or 
consult the GPM documentation.

Please report bugs via the GPM bug report forms (available from the labs)
or mail.

Changes since version of September 94 
-------------------------------------
1) Full implementation of ISO Input/Output procedures.
   (See separate documents - usingiso.stu  <- introduction to using ISO I/O
                             wirthiso      <- converting InOut etc. to ISO)
2) Implementation of some basic cursor manipulations (Use in conjunction with
   ANSISYS) - allows cursor to be hidden and restored, resized and gets the
   screen current attributes at the cursor.

Changes since version of June 95
---------------------------------
1) A number of inconsistent results have been fixed in RealIO
2) The utility module DebugWrite has been added to the distribution - See
   the .def file for details.

Changes since version of July 95
---------------------------------
1) A minor bug fix in the run time system.
2) Fixed a bug in ProgArgs, which sometimes truncated user's arguments
3) Separation of the graphics libraries from the normal distribution.
   When the graphics libraries were produced in late 1992, attempts were made
   to try and include data about as many known SVGA video cards as possible.
   Since then a lot more cards (VESA etc) have become available, with differing
   setups and initialisations.  The SVGA autodetect facility can't always 
   correctly set up the card if it is not known to to the libraries.  Hence 
   some users have experienced problems.  Beginning with this distribution, 
   the graphics libraries will be packaged as a VGA and SVGA version 
   (gr_svga.zip and gr_vga.zip).  The contents of these two zips are the 
   necessary files in m2sym and m2lib directories.  Just uncompress the version
   require using => unzip gr_svga 
                 or unzip gr_vga.

Changes since version of August 95
----------------------------------
1) An error in compiling the ISO libraries could lead to a linker failure,
   with an apparent double inclusion of StdDevice.

Changes since version of November 95
------------------------------------
1) An minor bug fix to StdStrings
2) Fix to a build problem (inconsistent keys) with the graphics support
   libraries.  PLEASE NOTE :  The graphics libraries come in an SVGA and VGA
   versions (see above).   As the .def and .syx files are identical for both
   they are now include in ..\m2sym.  In ..\m2lib are two directories ..\vga
   and ..\svga.  Copy the files from the sub-directory for the adapter you want.
