%R Trace %N %R  F3   %N In the %Bsource window%N the current statement is marked traced.
		The statement is shown highlighted, and whenever it is executed
		it is first copied to the history log.
		If the statement is already traced, the trace is removed.

		Only executable statements may be traced. This excludes all
		comments and declarations. Furthermore the optimizer in the
		compiler deletes unreachable and duplicated code (usually
		break, continue or return statements); deleted code is not
		executable.

		In the %Bevaluation window%N the current expression is traced.
		This means that before each source statement is executed, the
		expression is re-evaluated, and is copied to the history log
		whenever it is found to have changed value.
		If the expression is already traced, the trace is removed.

		This command is not accepted in any other window.

		The program may also be run until a trace is encountered:
		see %RRun <F4>%N.

Press %R Help <F6> %N to return to the debugger.
