# **PC/XT Software Collection**

This repository contains a curated set of MS-DOS–era software suitable for IBM PC/XT-class machines and their Turbo XT derivatives.
The collection is **reconstructed entirely from publicly available Internet archives** and organized to represent a realistic, period-correct software environment for an 8088-based system.

It includes:

* Core MS-DOS utilities and tools
* Common applications from the late 1980s / early 1990s
* Programming languages, editors, diagnostics, and system utilities
* Games and other software appropriate for XT-class hardware

The goal of this project is to provide **a clean, organized, and historically informed snapshot** of what a functional Turbo XT system of the era might contain—useful for restoration, emulation, research, and retro-computing exploration.
