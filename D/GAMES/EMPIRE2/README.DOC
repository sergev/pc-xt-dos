I would like to thank you for buying EMPIRE 2.05.  I hope that you have
a lot of fun playing EMPIRE. 

There is an error in the manual with respect to the time it takes a city
to produce a cruiser.  Initial base production time for a cruiser is 36 
turns with a continued production time of 30 turns as opposed to the 42
and 35 turns described in the manual.

There are currently two EGA icon sets and 4 CGA icon sets included on
the disk.  The alternate icon sets can be accessed using the /i
command as described in the manual.  The difference in the EGA icon
sets is the color of players 1 and 2.  Icon set 1 has player 1 being
white and player 2 being red. In icon set 2, player 1 is red and
player 2 is magenta.

The CGA icon sets vary how the land icons are drawn.  Icon set 1 uses
a textured land using cyan and black with white coast lines.  Icon
set 2 has white land with magenta coast lines.  Icon set 3 has 
magenta as land while icon set 4 is like icon set 1 except the coast
lines are magenta.

If you don't like one of the icon sets, try another!

Tandy users please note that hitting the BREAK key will lock up the game.  
Also, there is a program available on some Tandy DOS disks that will allow 
your joystick to be used as a mouse.  EMPIRE is compatible with this program.

I'd like to thank Henry Colonna, Neil Harris, Wayne Dunham,
Alvin Files, Bob Jones, Bob Rakosky, Dan Moore and Jerry Pournelle for
suggesting some of the improvements that have gone into Empire over
the last year.

Interstel and I both appreciate suggestions, criticisms, comments,
ideas, and fan mail very much.  Send us a letter or postcard. We would
love to hear from you.  You can also reach me via electronic mail
through the GEnie Information Exchange or Compuserve.  My mail address
on GENIE is MB and Compuserve is 73637,3032.  We try to answer all the
mail we receive (but it might take a while). 

Because Interstel now publishes the same software on numerous computer
systems, please tell us what computer system you are executing the
software on (i.e.  IBM PC).  Failure to do so could result in a long
delay in answering your letter, or no answer at all, because we will
have to try and figure out what machine you are using.  In addition,
please send in the registration card enclosed with the software 
When you move, include Interstel in your list of address change notices.

INTERSTEL DOES NOT PASS THEIR REGISTERED OWNERS LIST TO ANY OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS.  THE LIST IS TREATED AS CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION.  SO, IF YOU GET COMPUTER JUNK MAIL IN THE FUTURE, IT IS NOT
OUR FAULT.

Have fun.
